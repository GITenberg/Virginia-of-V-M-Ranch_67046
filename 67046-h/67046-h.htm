CHAPTER I—VIRGINIA OF V. M. RANCH.
</h2>

<p>Down a winding mountain trail, a girl of sixteen
was riding on Comrade, her wiry red-brown
pony.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. The sky above was
a gleaming cloudless blue, the desert, below, stretching
to the far horizon, shimmered white in the sunlight,
while some bird in a canon near was caroling
a tipsy song of joy, but these things Virginia Davis
did not see or hear, for her eyes were gazing at the
rugged trail and her thoughts were puzzling over
the contents of a letter which her brother Malcolm
had brought to her that morning when he had returned
from the town of Douglas which was twenty
miles away.</p>

<p>Her father’s best friend had died the year before,
and had left a motherless girl all alone in the world.
When Mr. Selover realized that he had not long to
live he had written Mr. Davis asking him to become
the guardian of his daughter, Margaret, who
was then in a select boarding school in the East.</p>

<p>In some unaccountable manner, the letter had been
delayed for many months, and during that time, Mr.
Davis had also died, leaving Virginia and Malcolm
as sole owners of the vast cattle ranch which was
known as “The V. M.”</p>

<p>This morning Virginia had ridden to the top of
the trail where she often went when she wanted to
be alone with her thoughts, for the long delayed
letter had indeed brought a new problem to these
two young people.</p>

<p>This unknown Margaret Selover, it seemed, was
their father’s ward. Ought they not to assume the
responsibility which he would so gladly have taken
had he lived? And yet, what if the girl should
prove to be very unlike themselves? She might not
care to make her home on their wonderful desert,
and, if she did not, would it be right for them to
take her from an environment in which she was
happy and content? But how could they tell, since
they did not know her?</p>

<p>Comrade had carefully wended his way down the
mountain trail and had carried his young mistress,
who was deeply absorbed in thought, across the dry
creek, under a clump of cottonwood trees and up the
steep farther bank before the girl looked about her
with eyes that saw.</p>

<p>Her brother was galloping toward her. “Ho,
Virginia!” he hailed as he waved his wide sombrero.
“Did your Inspiration Peak help you to solve
our problem? What are we to do with our ward?”</p>

<p>The girl flashed a smile at the lad, whose frank,
bronzed face resembled her own, for, though he
was two years her senior, twins could not have
been more alike or dearer to each other.</p>

<p>“If only we knew what type of a girl this Margaret
is,” his sister replied as he wheeled his horse
about and rode by her side, “we could so much more
easily decide upon a plan. I did indeed receive an
inspiration, but one hard to carry out I fear. I
have been wishing that in some way we might become
acquainted with our ward without having her
know who we are.”</p>

<p>“You are right, sister,” Malcolm said seriously.
“I do not wish to invite this unknown girl to share
our home unless I am convinced that your life will
be made happier by the companionship. Our father
would not wish it otherwise. Now tell me your
plan.”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at her brother with unexpected
laughter in her violet-blue eyes. “It is one by which
we could become acquainted with our ward without
revealing to her our true identity. Harken and you
shall hear.”</p>

<p>Malcolm’s hearty laughter rang out when the half
serious, half merry plan had been told.</p>

<p>“If only we can persuade Uncle Tex to play the
role of elderly guardian,” he exclaimed. “I am sure
that your little drama, when staged, will bring about
the desired results, but, knowing our faithful old
overseer as well as I do, I fear that we may have a
tragedy, or a comedy, which perhaps would be equally
disastrous.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s amused expression had changed to one
of serious concern. “Brother,” she said, “if we do
carry out my plan, will it be quite honest to Margaret?”</p>

<p>“Not right in the beginning I must confess,” Malcolm
replied, “but, of course, we will at once tell
her the truth, if, after meeting her, we decided to
invite her to become one of our household, but, on
the contrary, if we find that she would not wish to
share our home, she would, of course, return to the
school where she has been for so many years. We
will at least have tried to do our duty as we see
it.”</p>

<p>“Then shall I write the letter?” the violet eyes
turned questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be the prologue to the little
drama. Rusty Pete is going to Silver Creek Junction
this afternoon and he will start the message
on its eastward journey.”</p>

<p>Again Malcolm’s amused laughter rang out. “It
will be better not to let Uncle Tex know that we
have designs upon him,” he said, “for, if he has an
inkling, even, that we are going to request him to
do a bit of ‘play actin’ as he would call it, he will
start at once for the mountain cabin, the location
of which we have never been able to discover.”</p>

<p>Their low rambling ranch house having been
reached, Virginia leaped to the ground, tossing the
reins to her brother, who, still chuckling to himself,
rode on down to the corral where an old, white-haired
man could be seen repairing a fence.</p>

<h2 title='MARGARET' id='chII'>
CHAPTER II—MARGARET.
</h2>

<p>Barbara Blair Wente in the Vine Haven
Seminary looked up from the cosy window seat
where she was comfortably curled, studying French
verbs, when she heard the door open. It was Margaret
Selover, her room-mate, who entered.</p>

<p>“Megsy,” Babs exclaimed with real concern as she
sprang to her feet and approached her friend with
hands outstretched, “what has happened, dear? Are
the algebra reports in and didn’t you pass, or, is it
something else?”</p>

<p>The newcomer looked at Barbara with eyes tear-brimmed.
She tried to speak but her lips quivered;
then, flinging herself down upon the couch, she
sobbed as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>Babs, deeply concerned, knelt by the side of her
room-mate, and tenderly smoothing the gold-brown
curls, she pleaded. “Tell me, Megsy darling, can’t
I help?”</p>

<p>Impulsively Margaret sat up, and, putting her
arms about her friend she sobbed. “Oh Babs, I can’t
do it! I won’t do it! I did think that my dad loved
me too much to punish me so.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, won’t do what?” Barbara sat on the couch
and drew her room-mate comfortingly close.
“Megsy, please begin at the beginning.”</p>

<p>Margaret put her hand in a pocket of her rose-colored
sweater-coat and drew out a crumpled letter.</p>

<p>“It’s from some-one way out on that terrible Arizona
desert,” she said, “and it informs me that my
father appointed a Mr. Davis as my guardian and
that the elderly gentleman, having given the matter
due thought, believes that it is time for me to come
to his home and take the place that my father wished
me to occupy, that of a rancher’s adopted daughter.”</p>

<p>Barbara gazed at her friend, almost unable to
comprehend. “Megsy, does this mean that you and
I are to be parted? That you are to leave Vine
Haven Seminary forever?”</p>

<p>For a brief moment Margaret sat as though
stunned, but her room-mate’s words roused her to
action. Springing up in a sudden tempest of anger,
she tore across the room, threw open the desk and
began to write rapidly.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed a few moments later. “I
have written my answer.”</p>

<p>“Read it,” Barbara begged, and in a hard cold
voice, very unlike her own, that was merry and
musical, Margaret read:</p>

<p class='ni mt10'>“My Dear Mr. Davis:—</p>

<p>“You undoubtedly have written with the kindest
of motives, but the picture you present is not in the
least attractive to me. A ranch house on a desolate
desert twenty miles from town is not a home which
I wish to enter.</p>

<p>“It is better for me to be honest and tell you at
once that I do not care to be your adopted daughter.
I have a sufficient income on which to live and I
shall remain at Vine Haven Seminary until I have
graduated. Soon after that I will be eighteen and
you will no longer be responsible for my actions.”</p>

<p>Barbara listened and watched, puzzled indeed at
this new Margaret. “Dear,” she said when her
friend paused, evidently expecting comment, “it is
very unlike you to hurt anyone. Couldn’t you add
a little something that would soften the sting?”</p>

<p>With a shrug Margaret turned back to the desk
and after a thoughtful moment, she again wrote a
few lines. Then in a voice more like her own, she
read:—“Since you were a close friend of my father,
I regret that I must make a decision that may seem
defiant, but surely you would not wish to have in
your home a rebellious daughter and that is what
I would be.</p>

<p class='tar' style='margin-right:6em;'>“Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class='tar sc mb10'>“Margaret Selover.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for further comment, the letter
was sealed and stamped.</p>

<p>“I hope you are doing right, dear,” Barbara said;
then, almost tearfully: “If you do go so far away,
Vine Haven will be more desolate to me than the
desert.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going!” Margaret remarked conclusively,
then, springing up, she added. “Three bells!
Time for French class and I haven’t even looked
at those verbs.”</p>

<p>Together they left their room and descended the
wide flight of stairs. “I’ll skip ahead and put this
letter in the mail pouch,” Margaret declared; then,
somewhat repentantly: “Really, Babs, I am sorry to
hurt the feelings of the old man. Father often told
me how much he admired Mr. Davis who was many
years his senior. They owned some mining property
together near Bisbee. In fact, I believe that my income
is derived from that same copper mine even
now. Well, someday soon I’ll send him another and
a kindlier letter, but there isn’t time today, and he
will, of course, be watching for an answer.”</p>

<p>But before the other letter was written, something
very unexpected happened.</p>

<h2 title='MARGARET’S REPLY' id='chIII'>
CHAPTER III—MARGARET’S REPLY.
</h2>

<p>Virginia was right in believing that she would
receive a reply from their unknown ward as soon
as one could possibly reach them. She had counted
the days that her own letter would require for its
journey east, and then had allowed one in between,
and so, at last, the day had dawned when she might
reasonably expect to hear from the unknown Margaret.</p>

<p>Luckily Rusty Pete was in town and would bring
the mail if there was any. Virginia, as she went
about her household tasks that morning, skipped
often to the wide front veranda and looked up the
mesa. A huge cactus growing at the top of the
trail stood like a silent sentinel and around this a
horse and rider soon appeared.</p>

<p>As the girl hoped, it was one of their two faithful
cow-boys. “Good morning, Rusty Pete,” she
called, as he rode alongside of the wide, shady
porch. “Have you letters for me?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I have, Miss Virginia. ’Pears to me
a couple is stowed away somewhar’s.” As he spoke,
the cow-boy thrust a lean, brown hand into his deep
leather pocket, then, with a sudden smile that wonderfully
illumined his rugged wind and sun bronzed
face, he removed his wide sombrero and drew forth
two letters that were very unlike each other in appearance.</p>

<p>“Didn’t pack the pouch ’long this time,” he explained,
“so put ’em thar for safe keepin’.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “Thank you, Rusty Pete,” she
said, and then the long, lank cow-boy rode on toward
the corral.</p>

<p>After glancing at the name in the upper left hand
corner of the lilac scented and tinted envelope, Virginia
uttered a little excited ejaculation, and, catching
her wide hat from the top step, she raced down
the trail to the fenced-in enclosure where Malcolm
was busy filling the trough near the windmill for
the yearlings were soon to be driven in from the
range.</p>

<p>“What ho?” he called when he saw the figure flying
toward him. The girl waved the two unopened
letters and Malcolm, equally interested, vaulted the
bars and stood at her side.</p>

<p>“Has our ward written?” he inquired merrily. “Is
she eager to be the adopted daughter of an elderly
rancher?”</p>

<p>There was a shade of anxiety in the violet eyes
that were lifted to him. “Brother,” she said, “I
wonder if we did wrong to deceive Margaret. Of
course it was merely to be a temporary arrangement.
If she comes, Uncle Tex is to play the role
of elderly guardian, that is, if he can be persuaded
to do so, then you, as cow-boy, and I, as housekeeper,
will have a splendid opportunity to become
acquainted with our ward and find out what manner
of girl she really is.”</p>

<p>While Virginia had been talking, she had opened
the tinted envelope. One glance at the very short
note and her merry laughter pealed forth.</p>

<p>“Brother, Margaret actually refuses to come.
Well, we surely may thank whatever kindly fate
has delivered us from having this young tornado in
our home.” Virginia handed the letter to Malcolm
as she spoke.</p>

<p>The other long white envelope she glanced at
casually, and, believing it to be the usual monthly
report from their lawyer’s office, she did not open
it, but waving farewell to her brother, who had
again vaulted the bars, Virginia returned to the
house and to her morning tasks.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later before she recalled the
long legal looking envelope.</p>

<p>“I might as well skim it over,” she thought, “and
then I can tell Malcolm about it and he will not need
to take the time to read it.”</p>

<p>Dropping down into a comfortable cushioned
wicker chair out on the veranda, Virginia leisurely
opened it. Her thoughts were wandering when she
began to read, but suddenly she sat erect and stared
at the typed page. Then she re-read it slowly from
the beginning to be sure that she had really understood
its purport.</p>

<p>Shags, the big collie dog, lying nearby, half dozing
in the sun was startled to see his mistress leap
to her feet and tear madly down the trail toward
the corral. Believing that he might miss something
of unusual interest if he did not follow, he raced
after, barking and bounding.</p>

<p>Malcolm looked up in surprise. “Ho Sis,” he
called, “had you overlooked a postscript in our
ward’s letter? Is she coming after all?”</p>

<p>Then noting how pale was his sister’s face, he
hastened to her side. “It’s a letter from Mr. Benton,
our father’s lawyer. I don’t understand business
matters as you do, and perhaps I do not rightly
comprehend the meaning of this. I sincerely hope
I do not.”</p>

<p>But Virginia had rightly understood. Mr. Denton,
their lawyer in Douglas had written:</p>


<p class='mt10 ni'>“Dear young friends:—</p>

<p>“This morning a letter was received by me that
you may be able to interpret better than I can. I
did not know that your father had been appointed
guardian of a girl named Margaret Selover, but the
letter which I have this day received from an eastern
law firm informs me that the income which has been
sent, since her father’s death, to this young girl,
has been abruptly discontinued as the mines from
which it is derived are no longer paying.</p>

<p>“Since Miss Selover is referred to as your
father’s ward, I presume that she is residing with
you, and so I thought best to communicate with you
at once.</p>

<p>“Trusting that the deprivation will be but
temporary,</p>

<p style='margin-left:6em'>“I remain,</p>
<p style='margin-left:8em'>“Your faithful friend and adviser,</p>
<p class='sc mb10' style='margin-left:10em'>“Harry L. Benton.”</p>

<p>“Which means?” Virginia’s tone was one of inquiry.</p>

<p>“Which means that we will have to lasso that
young tornado and bring her here, whether or not
she wishes to come,” was the dismal reply, “for
surely, you and I, Virg, cannot afford to pay Miss
Selover’s tuition at a fashionable seminary.”</p>

<p>“No, we cannot,” his sister agreed, then—“Shall
I write to poor Margaret and tell her the
sad news?”</p>

<p>“I think the ones to be pitied are Virginia and
Malcolm,” the lad spoke vehemently, “but, there is
no alternative. Write the letter and I’ll take it to
Silver Creek Junction. I’m going that far right
after lunch to help drive in the yearlings.”</p>

<p>A week later another letter bearing the Vine
Haven postmark arrived on the desert. With a
heavy heart Virginia opened it, and after a hurried
perusal, she decided that “lassoing the young tornado”
as her brother had called their ward, was not
to be a pleasant pastime.</p>


<p class='ni mt10'>“My dear Mr. Davis,” she read:</p>

<p>“Your letter came this morning informing me
that my income has ceased. I believe that to be an
absolute untruth, a ruse to try to force my obedience
to your will. Of course you have accomplished your
end for I am too proud to remain at this seminary
unless I can pay my tuition, but I warn you, my stay
with you will be no longer than absolute necessity
requires and it will in no way add to your happiness
to have a rebellious girl in your home.</p>

<p>“I hope that you will reconsider and send my allowance
which is already one week over due.</p>

<p class='sc tar mb10'>“Margaret Selover.”</p>

<p>“Whew-oo!” Malcolm’s whistle was one of
mingled astonishment and amusement.</p>

<p>“I feel about as I did when I broke in Wild Fire,
Virg,” he said, his grey eyes twinkling at the recollection.
“I had never before met a spirit so untamed.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed. “This defiant young lady
would not feel complimented to have her temper
compared to a bucking broncho,” she said, “but I
suppose that come she must, until she is old enough
to be self-supporting, but my heart aches for her.
I am almost inclined to tell her the whole truth.
Shall I?” The violet eyes were moist and imploring,
but the lad shook his head.</p>

<p>“Let’s carry out our original plan first. We may
even yet find a loop hole of escape.”</p>

<p>Slowly and thoughtfully, Virginia walked back
over the well worn trail to the ranch house. She
was planning the letter which later was written and
mailed.</p>

<h2 title='PLOTTING AND PLANNING' id='chIV'>
CHAPTER IV—PLOTTING AND PLANNING.
</h2>

<p>That evening before the wide fireplace on which
a mesquite root was cheerfully burning, three people
sat plotting and planning.</p>

<p>Virginia had at last decided to take Uncle Tex
into their confidence. He it was who had first taught
five-year-old Malcolm to ride and shoot and Virginia
he loved as dearly as he could have loved an
own daughter if he had had one.</p>

<p>“It’s powerful unpleasant business, ’pears like to
me,” the old man said as he shook his shaggy grey
head, “but I reckon if you uns cal-late its yer dooty,
we all will have to put it through, but yer ol’ Uncle
Tex is common poor at the play actin’.”</p>

<p>He looked so truly distressed that Virginia drew
her chair closer and placed her slim, strong hand on
his arm. “Don’t be troubled about it yet, Uncle
Tex, we’ll make it as easy for you as we can.”
Then, looking to her brother, she added with
thoughtful seriousness. “I wonder if we ought to
permit our ward to journey across the continent
alone. I am confident that she has always been protected
by her father’s loving care, just as I have
been, although I feel sure that I could make the
journey alone and in safety, and yet, since Margaret
is our ward, we are responsible, as I am sure that our
father would wish us to be, for her well being.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Virg,” the lad replied. “I wish
we knew some one who might be coming west at
the same time, who would consent to keep an eye
on our young tornado.”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in the eyes of the lad, and
his sister, noticing it, exclaimed: “Malcolm Davis,
I actually believe that you like our ward all the better
because she is high spirited.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the lad confessed, “I do like spirit, I’ll
agree. I’d like to see the girl.”</p>

<p>“Ah reckon we-all will see plenty of her before
we’re finished with her.” Uncle Tex drawled in so
doleful a tone that Malcolm laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Or until she finishes us,” he exclaimed merrily
as he rose and wound the clock.</p>

<p>“We must retire early tonight, Sis,” he added,
“for I want to be in the saddle before daybreak as
I am due at Slater’s to help round up the young
steers that are to be shipped to Chicago next week.”</p>

<p>The girl sprang up and looked down at the old
man who sat staring dismally into the fire.</p>

<p>“Uncle Tex,” she exclaimed gaily as she stooped
and caught one of his work-hardened hands, “you
look as though you had just received an invitation
to your own funeral. Don’t you enjoy the prospect
of being guardian, pro tem, to a young lady
tornado?”</p>

<p>“Don’ know nothin’ ’bout protems, Miss Virginia,
dearie, but I do kinda dread bein’ gardeen to a gal
that don’ want to be gardeened nohow, but if you’n
Malcolm need my help, sech as it is, yer welcome to
it.”</p>

<p>The old man had risen and impulsively the girl
threw her arms about him and pressing her fresh
young cheek against the wrinkled and leathery one,
she said consolingly: “Now, Uncle Tex, dear, don’t
lie awake worrying about your new responsibility
for if Margaret proves tractable, which means nice
and pleasant, we will tell her the whole truth, but if
she continues disagreeable and rebellious, we will
soon pack her off somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Then she bade goodnight to the old man who had
been her father’s first overseer and he departed for
his room which adjoined the kitchen, for the girl
would not permit him to sleep in the less comfortable
bunk house with the younger cow-boys. Then
she too retired, but she lay awake until late wondering
what the future held for them.</p>

<h2 title='MALCOLM’S GREAT NEWS' id='chV'>
CHAPTER V—MALCOLM’S GREAT NEWS.
</h2>

<p>The next day was a busy one at the V. M. Ranch,
for a crate of fruit arrived for Virginia and she preserved
and canned until at last the grandfather
clock in the living-room chimed the hour of five.
Then she stood back and proudly surveyed row after
row of jars, some golden and others glowingly
ruddy.</p>

<p>Then, taking off her all-over apron, and donning
her wide felt hat, she thought that to get a breath
of the cool evening air, she would ride toward the
Slater Ranch and meet her brother who would soon
be returning.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex saddled Comrade for her, and then
stood watching as his beloved “gal” cantered away
toward the mesa. She turned to wave to him when
she reached the sentinel cactus which stood with two
branches outstretched like defending arms that were
covered with long prickly thorns.</p>

<p>She drew rein when she reached the highest point
and sat on her red-brown pony watching the glory
of the setting sun. At last when the golden light
had left all but the highest mountain peaks, and deep
shadows were purpling the canons, she beheld
silhouetted against the after glow, a horseman approaching
at a gallop.</p>

<p>Believing it to be her brother, she rode down the
trail to meet him. Malcolm, she realized, was
hilariously excited about something, for every now
and then he snatched off his sombrero and waved
it to the waiting girl.</p>

<p>“News! Great news!” he shouted as he drew near.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Virginia asked as she wheeled her
pony about and side by side they rode toward home
through the deepening dusk.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you three guesses.” This had been their
way of telling news items to each other from their
earliest childhood.</p>

<p>“Oh brother, don’t make me guess it this time. I
just know that it is something of unusual interest,”
the girl implored.</p>

<p>“It is.” This in Malcolm’s most tantalizing manner.
“Well, I’ll give you a hint. It’s something
about the coming of our young tornado.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Virginia’s expression brightened. “Have
you heard of someone who will escort her from the
East?”</p>

<p>“Righto, Sis, you’re doing splendidly, but
who?”</p>

<p>They were descending the narrow trail from the
mesa, and, since Virginia was in the lead, she could
not see the elated expression on the face of her
brother.</p>

<p>“Um-m, let me see,” she replied thoughtfully.
“May I have five minutes to think?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you until the Dry Creek is crossed,”
was the merry reply.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence while Virginia’s thoughts
were busy trying to solve the mystery. Of course
Malcolm must have heard of this possible escort
during his day at the Slater Ranch while rounding
up the steers that were to be sent to Chicago.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have it!” she whirled about in her saddle
to exclaim exultingly.</p>

<p>“Some one, of course, is to
accompany the car-load of steers to the big city and
that some-one will meet Margaret there and escort
her back to Douglas.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations sister! Now, since you are so
clever at guessing tonight, suppose you tell me <i>who</i>
is to go with the cattle.”</p>

<p>“Malcolm Davis, I do believe that you are,” the
girl instantly declared. “There’s a ring in your
voice which convinces me that you are at last to
have the opportunity for which you have so longed.
Are you now old enough to be trusted on so important
a mission?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Slater thinks so. He asked me to go,” the
lad replied jubiliantly, as he swung from his saddle,
“but wait until after supper and then I will tell you
my plan.”</p>

<h2 title='FAREWELL TO BOARDING SCHOOL' id='chVI'>
CHAPTER VI—FAREWELL TO BOARDING SCHOOL.
</h2>

<p>A week passed and Margaret Selover had received
a letter, supposedly from the elderly Mr.
Davis, bidding her start on her westward journey
Friday, the 25th.</p>

<p>Barbara Blair Wente, fluffy, golden and petite,
sat curled up on the window seat of the room they
had shared together for the past year looking the
picture of misery.</p>

<p>“I hate him! Hate him!” Margaret was saying
as she thumped a small pillow preparatory to packing
it in her trunk. Then she added, rising and
looking her defiance, “but he won’t keep me long,
Babs. You may be sure of that. I’ll make life so
unpleasant for my hoary guardian that he will soon
be glad to release me. Oh dear, how I do wish that
I were older so that I might begin earning my own
living, but just wait until I’m eighteen. Then I
will do something. Other girls do and I believe I
am normally clever.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose is to meet you in Chicago?”
Barbara inquired.</p>

<p>“Don’t know and don’t care,” was the somewhat
muffled reply from the trunk, the cover of which
was closed a moment later with a snap. Then Margaret
sat upon it as she remarked:—“My guardian
kindly informed me that I need have nothing whatever
to say to my escort if I did not wish to be
friendly, but that, at least, I must allow him to look
out for my welfare.”</p>

<p>Babs sat up and looked interested. “Margaret,
what if it should be a real cow-boy like the ones
we have seen in the moving pictures. Those handsome
young giants who are always helping damsels
in distress. Wouldn’t that be romantic? I’m just
wild to see a live cow-boy myself. They are fascinating
on the screen.”</p>

<p>“Well, they don’t appeal to me,” Margaret replied,
“I prefer boys who are dressed in civilized
clothes and who know how to talk. All of the
cow-boys in fiction use the queerest kind of a language.”</p>

<p>Four bells pealed through the corridors and Barbara
rose reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Even if my heart is nearly broken over your departure,
Megsy, I suppose I’ll have to go down to
this old recitation,” she said.</p>

<p>Margaret also rose and going to the window, she
looked out at the bleak orchard. “I’m not going.
What’s the use of working out problems in geometry
today when tomorrow I will be gone?”</p>

<p>Just at that moment there were skipping footsteps
outside in the corridor followed by an imperative
knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Barbara opened it to admit a pretty, eager-eyed
child, who held up a yellow envelope. “It’s for
you, Miss Margaret,” she said. “Mrs. Martin said
to bring it right up.”</p>

<p>The girl, as she opened the telegram, sincerely
hoped that in it she would find a message bidding
her to remain at the school, but she did not.</p>

<p>“Leave, if possible, on the 8.30 train tonight
which reaches Chicago at six tomorrow morning.
Wear a red ribbon bow that you may easily be recognized.”</p>

<p>It was signed: “Peter Wallace.”</p>

<p>Margaret’s eyes flashed and she tore the telegram
to bits. “Peter Wallace, indeed! I’m not going to
take orders from a wild west cow-boy. He may
meet the six o’clock train tomorrow morning, but
I won’t be on it.”</p>

<p>However, when Barbara had reluctantly departed
for her class, Margaret found that the prospect of
arriving in Chicago alone and unprotected was not
a pleasant one to contemplate. With her father she
had spent one day in the big city and she remembered
how she had clung to his hand when they had
crossed the streets and how terrorized she had been
by the rush and roar of the traffic.</p>

<p>An hour later, when Babs returned, she was surprised
to find that the trunk had been taken to the
station. That evening Mrs. Martin and Barbara accompanied
the young traveler to the train, as the
principal of the school wished to be sure that her
young charge was started safely on this, her first
journey alone, and in the care of the kindly conductor.</p>

<p>It was not until the next morning, when the
train was slowly entering Chicago, that Margaret,
weary from an excited and sleepless night, placed
a small red ribbon bow on the lapel of her warm,
gold-brown coat, wondering, as she did so, what
manner of person her escort would be.</p>

<h2 title='MARGARET’S ESCORT' id='chVII'>
CHAPTER VII—MARGARET’S ESCORT.
</h2>

<p>Meanwhile Malcolm in a nearby hotel was preparing
to play the role upon which he and Virginia had decided.</p>

<p>A grey wig and mustache changed his appearance
so completely, that even one well acquainted with
him would not, at first glance, have recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you, Mr. Peter Wallace,” he
said to his beaming reflection. Then, donning his
sombrero, he started out as he thought, “Now I
know what I will look like twenty years hence. I
do wish Virg was here. How she would laugh to
see me in this disguise.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when the train drew to a standstill,
Mr. Peter Wallace watched each passenger
alight with the aid of a colored porter.</p>

<p>At last he saw an unusually pretty young girl in
a gold-brown suit and trim traveling hat who stood
for a moment looking around helplessly.</p>

<p>Malcolm’s heart pounded queerly. He hadn’t
supposed that their rebellious ward would be
good-looking. In fact he hadn’t thought anything about
it.</p>

<p>He went closer, almost believing that this maiden
could not be the one he expected, but there was a
small red ribbon bow on the lapel of her coat.</p>

<p>For a moment Malcolm almost forgot that he
was a middle-aged rancher and was about to advance
in his usual buoyant fashion, when a warning
thought recalled to him: “You are Mr. Peter Wallace,
not Malcolm Davis who is to greet this young
girl.” And so, when Margaret’s almost frightened
gaze, wandering over the heedless, hurrying throng,
turned toward the approaching stranger, she saw a
tall, broad-shouldered man, whose stride might have
suggested that he was younger than his grey hair
indicated.</p>

<p>“Are you Miss Selover?” he inquired in as matter-of-fact
a tone as he could assume.</p>

<p>“I am,” the girl replied, rather frigidly, now that
she was no longer frightened. “Are you Mr. Peter
Wallace?”</p>

<p>Malcolm did not voice his reply, but she took it
for granted, as he had at once reached for her
satchels. She was secretly glad that her escort was
middle-aged. Somehow that fact made her feel
more at ease.</p>

<p>When they had crossed the city in the jolting,
rattling omnibus, and the girl, at last, was comfortably
seated in the luxurious chair car, Malcolm
said, “I will leave you now, Miss Selover, but at
noon I will come for you and we will lunch together.”</p>

<p>When he was gone Margaret watched the flying
landscape without seeing it.</p>

<p>This man, she thought, was evidently a middle-aged
rancher, and yet he spoke English as correctly
as any of the boys she knew. She had not supposed
such a thing possible.</p>

<p>How she wished that he were her guardian, instead
of that illiterate Mr. Davis who had written
such unkind letters to her, and who had unjustly
deprived her of her rightful allowance. She just
hated him and she always would.</p>

<p>Two hours later her reverie was interrupted by
the decidedly pleasant voice of her escort who was
telling her that he would accompany her to the diner.</p>

<p>Malcolm was thoroughly enjoying this strange
new experience and yet there were moments when
he wished that he might snatch off his disguise and
tell the whole truth to the girl, who, now and then
turned toward him such wistful brown eyes, but
he would wait and let Virginia decide when to make
the revelation.</p>

<h2 title='THE ARRIVAL OF MARGARET' id='chVIII'>
CHAPTER VIII—THE ARRIVAL OF MARGARET.
</h2>

<p>Virginia was up before the sun on the day that
she was expecting the arrival of her brother and
his rebellious ward.</p>

<p>“I’m so interested and excited,” she confided to
Shags who trotted along at her side when she went
down to what Rusty Pete called “the hen corral”
to feed the plump biddies that resided there.</p>

<p>Promptly at nine o’clock they were to depart for
Silver Creek Junction, at which lonely station the
trains would stop, when flagged, or when passengers
had so requested.</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Tex, dressed in a linen suit and wearing
a wide panama hat, was miserably uncomfortable,
and, as he stood at the window in the big
living-room, he looked longingly toward the distant
mountains. Even yet he could escape, but if his
“gal” needed his help at this play acting, he’d try
to do his best, but how he did wish that he might
change places with Slim, the lithe young cow-boy
who at that moment was within the range of the old
man’s vision endeavoring to break the wild spirits
of a bucking broncho.</p>

<div id='003' class='mt10 mb10 w003'>
  <img src='images/illus-003.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>Skipping to the side of the elderly man, in a manner much too frivolous for the wearer of such sombre attire.</p>
</div>

<p>Hearing an inner door open, he turned and beheld
what might have been an elderly housekeeper
in bonnet and shawl, a black bombazine dress the
girl had borrowed from dear old Grandmother
Slater.</p>

<p>Skipping to the side of the elderly man, in a manner
much too frivolous for the wearer of such
sombre attire, the girl caught his hand as she exclaimed
merrily: “Why Uncle Tex, I mean Mr.
Davis, how stylish you do look! If you have observed
yourself in the mirror, I ’spect you will want
to dress up like this every day in the year.”</p>

<p>The old man looked very miserable as he slowly
shook his head. “No, ah won’t, Miss Virginia
dearie,” he said. “Ah was jest thinkin’ as how
ah’d rather rope the contrariest steer thar ever was
than be play-actin’ this-a-way.” Then wheedlingly
he added, “Don’t you spose as how you could get
along jest as well without me? Couldn’t you be
sayin’ as how her gardeen had gone away for a
spell?”</p>

<p>The old man’s pleading was interrupted by a
merry honking from without and Virginia caught
his work-hardened hand and led him out to the
waiting car.</p>

<p>The weather-bronzed features of Rusty Pete
widened into a smile and he found it hard to keep
his mirth within bounds. He wanted to shout. It
was as good as a circus, he thought, to see Uncle
Tex rigged up like a gentleman, but, when he saw
how red and uncomfortable the old man looked, the
kind hearted cow-boy refrained from uttering the
bantering remark which the old overseer’s appearance
had suggested. However, when he was alone
on the front seat of the big touring car, his grin
resembled that of the Cheshire cat, nor did it cease
until the railway station was reached.</p>

<p>Several ponies were tied to the hitching posts and
a spirited young mustang belonging to Slick Cy, a
cow-boy from the Slater Ranch, reared as the car
came to a stop nearby.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex and the supposed housekeeper
alighted. Virginia, glancing at the poor old man,
realized that he would probably be tongue-tied when
the moment to speak arrived and so she said impulsively:
“Uncle Tex, you needn’t say those lines
of welcome that I taught you, if you’d rather not.
I’ll play the part of a garrulous housekeeper and
talk so much and so fast that you won’t have a
chance to get a word in edgeways.”</p>

<p>There was a deep sigh of relief from the old man
who said gratefully: “Thanks, Miss Virginia dearie.
I wan’t cut out for play-actin’, seems like.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the train!” Rusty Pete sang out
from the auto. Virginia and the old man turned
toward the mountain tunnel through which appeared
two great black engines puffing noisily. Then the
long train slowly came into sight and to a standstill.</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart was pounding like a trip hammer.
She was wondering what their ward would
look like, cross and homely and disagreeable, one
might judge from her letters.</p>

<p>There were only two people to alight and at first
the western girl thought them to be a father and
daughter and believed that her brother had not
come. When she did recognize his walk and bearing,
she could hardly keep from laughing at his
disguise. Surely, he made a most good-looking
middle-aged rancher, but the trim, really pretty
young girl, who was walking toward them at his
side, surely <i>she</i> could not be the ward who had
written such defiant letters. There must be a mistake
somewhere.</p>

<p>For a moment, Virginia herself almost forgot the
role that she was to play, but recalling it, just in
time, she hurried forward with hands outstretched.
“Good day, Mr. Wallace,” she said; then to Margaret,
“Are you Miss Selover?” Without waiting
for a reply she hurried on.</p>

<p>“I am your guardian’s housekeeper. We hope
that you’ll be happy here. I assure you that Mr.
Davis deeply regretted the circumstances which compelled
him to send for you and he hopes to be
able to permit you to return to school next year if
you are not happy here.” Then, the introductory
remarks having been finished, as planned, Virginia
concluded, “Come with me, Miss Margaret, and I
will introduce you to your guardian.”</p>

<p>They advanced a few steps toward the station
house, where Uncle Tex had been standing when
Virginia had hurried forward to greet the newcomers,
but the old man was not to be seen.</p>

<p>“Excuse me one moment,” the astonished Virginia
exclaimed. Then she went over to the waiting
auto. Rusty Pete’s grin was wider than ever,
if such a feat were possible. “Rusty, where <i>is</i> Uncle
Tex?” the girl asked him.</p>

<p>The cow-boy pointed to a cloud of dust which
was rapidly disappearing in the direction of V. M.
Ranch. “He got panicky, I guess, for all of a
sudden he ran over here like a mad man, jumped
up on Slick Cy’s horse and away he went. He
didn’t stop to explanate anything, but rode as though
the wild wolves were after him.”</p>

<p>“Poor Uncle Tex!” Virginia laughed, and then
she returned to explain to Margaret that her
guardian had suddenly remembered that he had a
very important engagement, but that in all probability
they would find him awaiting them at the
ranch house.</p>

<p>But Virginia was wrong in her surmise. When
the ranch house was reached she went at once to
the small bed room near the kitchen. The door was
open and the room was empty, but a neatly folded
linen suit lay over a chair while the Panama hat
reposed on the bed. Uncle Tex was gone to his
cabin somewhere over in the mountains.</p>

<p>Sinking down on another chair, Virginia
laughed merrily, but hearing someone tap upon the
door, she sat up with suddenly resumed dignity, for
she was still playing a part, but it was only her
brother who entered.</p>

<h2 title='THE REVELATION' id='chIX'>
CHAPTER IX—THE REVELATION.
</h2>

<p>“Virg,” Malcolm blurted out, “I feel that we are
not doing right to treat a lonely orphan girl in
this fashion. I am positive that I heard her crying
in her room just now. I know it is premature, and
not at all according to our plans, but I do wish you
would go in and comfort her. Tell her the whole
truth, Sis, and if she doesn’t want to stay with us,
I’ll write back to that eastern seminary and see
what can be done.”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at her brother with laughing eyes,
but they quickly sobered as she said, “I agree with
you, Malcolm. I believe that we have made a mistake.
The truth is always best after all. Suppose
you go to your room now and reappear just yourself.”</p>

<p>The lad went away whistling. Somehow, he felt
happier than he had in many a day.</p>

<p>Virginia tapped lightly on the closed door of the
big sunny southwest room to which she had taken
their ward immediately upon their arrival at V. M.
A half sob accompanied the words, barely heard by
the listener. “Come in.”</p>

<p>On the bed Margaret had thrown herself in an
abandon of grief. Virginia knelt by her side and
said compassionately, “Margaret dear, don’t cry
this way. Was it so very hard for you to come
to us?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. Next to losing father it was the hardest
thing I ever had to face,” was the broken reply that
came from the depths of a pillow. “But forgive
me, if I seem ungrateful. Mr. Wallace has been
telling me that Mr. Davis did not send for me from
unkind motives, and so I have changed my mind.
Tell him, please, that I am not going to be rebellious
and that I’ll try to be cheerful and bring a little
sunshine into his home. He must be a very lonely
old man and he was kind to my father.”</p>

<p>Tears were brimming Virginia’s eyes. “Dearie,”
she said, “lie here and rest for an hour, but when
you hear the Chinese gong, come out to dinner.
A pleasant surprise will be awaiting you. At
least I hope that you will like it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Margaret said without lifting her
head from her pillow. She felt too dead inside
to care about surprises. Nothing mattered if she
had to remain on this desolate desert. The only surprise
that could interest her would be the news that
she might return to Vine Haven and to Babs.</p>

<p>However, the words of the housekeeper had
soothed her more than she realized. Her sobbing
soon ceased and she actually fell into a light slumber
from which she awakened refreshed.</p>

<p>Rising, she washed away the tear stains and
brushing her short gold-brown curls, she fastened
them back with a wide barette.</p>

<p>Then she went out into the big, pleasant, homey
living-room, but no one was there. Suddenly recalling
the promised surprise, she was wondering
what it would be, when a door, leading out upon
a wide veranda, opened and a young girl entered
followed by a tall, good-looking lad.</p>

<p>They approached the astonished ward and, Virginia,
holding out both hands, said impulsively,
“Margaret, can you ever forgive us for play actin’,
as Uncle Tex called it. Your guardian isn’t an
old man. He is my brother, Malcolm. I just don’t
know how to go about explaining it,” she looked
rather helplessly at the lad.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, Sis,” he said. “Margaret, the truth is
that you wrote such—such—” even Malcolm was at
a loss how to tell the tale.</p>

<p>“Such horrid, disagreeable letters,” his ward put
in, a dimple appearing as she smiled, “that you were
sure you wouldn’t want to keep me. I don’t blame
you a bit!” she declared vehemently. Then she
surprised them both by impulsively kissing Virginia
and saying:</p>

<p>“I just <i>know</i> that I’m going to be happy with <i>you</i>.
It will be like having a sister, a really and truly one,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hum-m!” said Malcolm with mock seriousness,
“You aren’t so pleased to have a really, truly brother
it would seem.”</p>

<p>Then, when the girl flashed a smile at him, he
added, “However I refuse to be your brother. I
shall remain your stern guardian. Aren’t you
skeered of me, as Uncle Tex says.”</p>

<p>The lad’s tanned face was so good-looking and
pleasant, his grey eyes so frank and merry that
his ward laughingly shook her head as she happily
replied:</p>

<p>“I’m not skeered the least bit. I just know that
I’m going to love you both.”</p>

<p>That evening the three young people sat around
the fireplace and had a most delightful get-acquainted
visit. Virginia told Margaret about the
stage-fright which had caused Uncle Tex to depart
with speed to the mountains.</p>

<p>“He won’t be back for a week, I’ll wager,” Malcolm
laughingly declared.</p>

<p>Then Margaret asked: “Virginia, what did you
expect me to look like?”</p>

<p>The other girl smiled but shook her head. “Don’t
ask me,” she pleaded. “The picture in my imagination
was so different from the real you, it would be
a sacrilege to tell it.”</p>

<p>The dimple again appeared, but it was a somber
Margaret who replied. “I don’t blame you for thinking
me just horrid, but I did so want to remain at
boarding school with Babs.” Then turning to Virginia
she asked:</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever had a yearning to go east to
school?” Malcolm glanced quickly at his sister,
who was gazing almost wistfully into the fire. It
was a long moment before she replied, then she
said:</p>

<p>“Yes, Margaret, I did want to go. In fact
I had my trunk packed and was to have started the
next day for a seminary in the East, just out of
New York, when father was taken ill. How glad
I am that I had not already departed, for no one
thought dad’s illness would be serious and they
would not have sent for me. He left us one week
from that day.” Then placing a loving hand on
the arm of her brother who sat near, she added,
“Malcolm was planning to attend a military academy
that winter, but when dad was gone, brother’s presence
was needed here on the ranch and I just
couldn’t go and leave him alone.”</p>

<p>Tears sprang to the eyes of Margaret. All her life
she had been petted and pampered, as she had been
an only child and so she had not learned the joy
of that self-sacrifice which she now saw shining in
the violet-blue eyes of her new friend.</p>

<p>Not wishing to sadden their ward, Virginia
sprang up and poked at the fire. “Dance, little
flames,” she said merrily, “and show our guest how
prettily a mesquite root can burn.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t call me a guest,” Margaret begged
impulsively. “I want to be home folks. It’s so long
since I had a real home.” She had risen and had
placed an arm about the western girl who still stood
looking down at the fire. As Malcolm watched
them, he thought that nowhere could two more lovely
girls be found although they were very unlike
each other.</p>

<p>The grandfather clock was soon telling the hour
of nine, which was bed-time for the dwellers of
V. M. Ranch. The lad rose and placed a wire screen
in front of the fire as he said gaily: “Girls, don’t
despair of getting an ‘iddication,’ as Uncle Tex calls
it. Most anytime we may find a paying mine. I am
convinced that there is one in these mountains, and
when it is found, three trunks will be packed and
we will all depart for the centers of learning.”
Then, to Virginia, he added, “Margaret will want
to sleep late, for I am sure that she is unusually tired
after that long hard journey, and, just for the
luxury of it, suppose you sleep too. I’ll get my own
breakfast. I want to reach the Slater Ranch soon
after sunrise to hand in my report about the cattle
that I delivered in Chicago.”</p>

<p>Long after Margaret was in her comfortable bed,
she lay awake wondering what life on the desert was
to hold for her, but it was to be more interesting
and exciting than even her wildest dreams could
picture.</p>

<h2 title='THE LOST BROTHER' id='chX'>
CHAPTER X—THE LOST BROTHER.
</h2>

<p>The next day was a happy one for Margaret and
Virginia.</p>

<p>“Please give me some tasks to do that shall be my
very own,” the newcomer pleaded when breakfast
was over. Malcolm, true to his word, had long since
departed.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s just do everything together,” Virginia
replied. “That’s more sociable. First, we will make
the beds. I’ll spread one side and you the other,
and while we’re doing them, let’s chatter like magpies.
There are dozens of things I want to know
about you. First, is this Babs about whom you
tell, your very best friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed. Her full name is Barbara Blair
Wente, and, Virg, I do believe that you could put
her in a thimble, most, and not have a single one
of her sunny hairs show over the top, she’s that tiny.
She has a brother, but she seldom mentions him.
There is something very sad about him, but I don’t
understand what exactly. Once, when I went to our
room unexpectedly (that is, Babs thought I was in
class, and I was, only I went back for a book), I
found her crying as though her heart would break.
In one hand she held a crumpled letter and in the
other a picture of such a good-looking boy. Of
course I begged her to tell me, that is, if I could
help, but she said she just couldn’t tell the whole
story. However, I gathered from fragments that
her brother, Peyton, who is three years older than
she, had displeased their rather stern father and had
disappeared, no one knew where. ‘I love him so,
Megsy,’ Babs sobbed, ‘much more than I do anyone
on the whole earth now that mother is gone.’</p>

<p>“Just then a maid came to straighten our room,
and never again could I get Babs to talk about her
brother. ‘It hurts too much,’ she would tell me.</p>

<p>“The next day before I came away I asked:
‘Babsy, have you heard from Peyton yet?’ Tears
rushed to her eyes and she shook her head. ‘No,’
she replied, ‘he thinks he has disgraced us all and
he will never write, even to me.’”</p>

<p>“Poor girl,” Virginia said, with true sympathy
as she led the way to Malcolm’s room. “I know
how I would feel if my brother suddenly disappeared
and I didn’t know where he was. I don’t believe I
could stand it. In fact, I am sure I couldn’t. Did
you ever see Peyton?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” Margaret replied, “but I am pretty
sure that I have a snapshot of Babs that was taken
years ago with her brother. When I unpack my
trunk, I’ll look for it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Peyton came west. So many boys
do when they run away,” Virginia said as she
smoothed the top spread on Malcolm’s bed and
placed the pillows at just the right angle.</p>

<p>“Babs thinks he went to sea,” Margaret told her.
“Not that she has any reason for so thinking, but
he was always wild about water, ever since the days
when he sailed chip-vessels on a brook, Babs said.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s probably where he has gone. Poor,
poor girl, my heart aches for her.”</p>

<p>Then, catching Margaret’s hand, Virginia added:
“Megsy, you would just love to have our friend visit
you out here some time, wouldn’t you? Please tell
her, when you write, that she will be most welcome
whenever she wishes to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Virginia, thank you!” Margaret hugged the
taller girl. “I believe Babs would come some day.
She has an income of her own. You would just
love her, I know.”</p>

<p>Then, when the older girl departed kitchenward,
leaving her new friend to dust the living-room, Margaret
fell to happily dreaming of the day, which she
hoped would soon materialize, when her beloved
Babs would be a visitor on the V. M. Ranch.</p>

<h2 title='A LETTER TO BABS' id='chXI'>
CHAPTER XI—A LETTER TO BABS.
</h2>

<p>Margaret’s very own room in the ranch house
was delightfully homey. Glass doors opened upon a
wide veranda where a vine, which Virginia
watered daily, was growing luxuriantly. Each
spring it was covered with gay colored trumpet flowers.</p>

<p>A flood of sunshine was pouring in at the open
window facing the southwest and fell upon a small
desk at which Margaret was writing a long letter to
Babs. When it was finished the girl sat looking out
across the desert that was a shining sandy waste as
far as she could see, with here and there a scraggly
mesquite bush or towering above it, a thorny cactus.
Lonely, desolate, those were the words that Margaret
had repeatedly used in describing her dread
of the desert before she had really seen it, but now
in her soul there was slowly awakening an appreciation
of the peace, the bigness and the grandeur of
it all. How Babs would love it.</p>

<p>Margaret’s dreaming was suddenly interrupted by
a most unearthly noise close to the house. Hurrying
to the glass doors, the girl looked out and beheld
three ungainly little creatures that resembled
donkeys. Smilingly, she put her fingers in her ears
when she saw that once again, all three had opened
their mouths to bray in chorus. Margaret wondered
why they seemed to be calling, and she was soon to
learn, for she heard the living room door open and
saw Virginia skip out on the veranda and feed a
lump of sugar to each of the small mouse-colored
creatures.</p>

<p>Margaret stepped out. “What queer pets you
have, Virginia,” she said merrily.</p>

<p>“They are little wild burros,” the western girl told
her. “They come often to beg for a lump of sugar,
but their manner of serenading is not very musical.
Have you finished your letter to Babs?” she added.
“I have stayed away from your room for a long
hour that you might not be interrupted.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have finished it. Shall I read it to you?”</p>

<p>The two girls sat on the top step while Margaret
read: “Dearest Babs, I’m so happy, so happy, you
just can’t guess.” Then pausing, she glanced up
brightly.</p>

<p>“Won’t that be a pleasant surprise to Babs, for,
of course, she will expect my first letter to tell that
I am melting away in tears.”</p>

<p>Then followed a description of the journey west,
of the “play actin’,” as Uncle Tex called it, and of
her joyous surprise when the middle-aged rancher
and the housekeeper removed their disguises and
were really a girl and a boy of about her own age.</p>

<p>“And Oh, Babs,” Margaret continued reading.
“I know that you won’t be the least bit jealous when
I tell you that I am going to put Virginia Davis in
the same corner of my heart that you occupy. You
will love her, too, when you meet her, and now, just
listen to this wonderful bit of news. Virginia has
told me to invite you to visit us whenever you can,
and I am hoping that you will want to come for your
summer vacation. Of course that is months away,
but it’s such fun to plan. I’m going to write a
volume of a letter to you every week and I shall expect
one from you. Remember me to all of the girls
at Vine Haven, and tell them that they need not pity
me, after all, for I am having just a glorious time.”</p>

<p>Virginia moved closer and slipped an arm about
her friend. “I am glad that you are able to write
such a happy letter,” she said.</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. “Babs will be disappointed in
one way, because as yet I have not had an exciting
adventure to tell her. She thinks the West is full
of them, just like moving pictures, you know.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled. “Perhaps you will have an adventure
to tell about in your next letter,” she said,
little dreaming that she was speaking the truth.</p>

<h2 title='CHOOSING A PONY' id='chXII'>
CHAPTER XII—CHOOSING A PONY.
</h2>

<p>The next morning Virginia breakfasted at sunrise
with her brother. Margaret, who was not accustomed
to awakening at so early an hour, slept
until she heard voices outside her window. Upon
seeing Virginia and Malcolm walking toward the
corral, she sprang up and dressed hastily.</p>

<p>The brother and sister were on the way to a
fenced-in hollow, where a wiry desert grass grew
abundantly, and where several ponies were quietly
feeding.</p>

<p>“Which of the horses shall we give to Margaret
for her very own?” Virginia asked as she leaned
on a top rail and looked about.</p>

<p>“Can Margaret ride well?” Malcolm inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure that she can,” Virginia replied,
“because she belonged to an equestrian class at the
fashionable boarding school that she attended and
they went every Saturday for an afternoon canter.”</p>

<p>Malcolm looked a bit doubtful.</p>

<p>“Those Eastern horses are not like our little wild
ponies,” he said. “Perhaps we ought to start Margaret
with Tags.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughingly protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, brother, I wouldn’t ask Megsy to ride that
stupid old horse. I am sure that Margaret could
ride, well, say Star. I have ridden him several times,
and next to my Comrade I think he is the prettiest
pony that we have on the ranch.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the brother and sister heard
a merry hallooing, and, turning, they saw Margaret
skipping toward them.</p>

<p>“Virginia,” she exclaimed reproachfully as she
came up, quite out of breath, “why didn’t you waken
me? I want always to get up when you do.”</p>

<p>“But it was before sunrise, and I know that you
are not used to being up so early,” the other girl replied
as she slipped an arm about the newcomer,
who said enthusiastically:</p>

<p>“Oh Virg, what a pretty horse that red-brown
one is. It looked up and neighed just as though
it were trying to say ‘Good morning!’”</p>

<p>Virginia was about to explain that the graceful,
alert little horse to which Margaret referred was her
own dear Comrade that had been given her by her
father when it was a colt, but, before she could
speak, she heard Malcolm saying: “Sister and I were
looking over the mounts just now trying to decide
which one we would give to you for your very own.”</p>

<p>His ward turned toward him with eyes that
glowed. “Oh, how kind you both are,” she exclaimed,
appreciatively. “I would just love to have
a pony all for my very own. May I choose any one
that I wish?”</p>

<p>The eager glance was questioning Virginia, and
unhesitatingly that maiden smiling replied, “Yes, indeed,
you may Megsy.”</p>

<p>For a minute Margaret’s glance swept the pasture.</p>

<p>“I just love that red-brown pony,” she said at
last, “It reminds me of the one I had when I was a
little girl.” Then as a sudden thought came to her,
she added, “but which is the one that you ride,
Virg?”</p>

<p>The Western girl unhesitatingly replied: “I ride
Star sometimes, the black and white wiry little fellow
with the dark star on his forehead. You may
have Comrade, if you like him best, to be your very
own.”</p>

<p>Malcolm, knowing how dearly his sister loved the
pony that their father had given to her, was about
to protest, but Virginia motioned him to be silent,
then aloud she added, “Brother, will you ask Slim
to bring the two ponies to the ranch house at nine?
I want to return Grandmother Slater’s bombazine
dress, and I am sure that Margaret will enjoy a
ride across the desert.”</p>

<p>Then arm in arm the two girls returned to the
ranch house while the lad saddled his lively young
broncho and rode away, waving his sombrero when
they turned at the porch steps to watch him.</p>

<p>“Now shall I unpack my trunk?” Margaret smiled
up happily. “I must find my riding habit.”</p>

<p>As she unpacked, Megsy kept watching for the
kodak picture of Babs and her brother, Peyton,
which she believed that she had tucked in somewhere
but it was not discovered. “Well, it really doesn’t
matter in the least,” the girl declared, as she smiled
up at Virginia who sat on the ledge of the bed watching
her. “I have a darling picture of Babs and we
do not care what Peyton looks like.”</p>

<p>Then diving into the depths of her trunk, she
brought out a book filled with kodak pictures, and
sitting beside her friend, Margaret turned the pages
and told the story of each one. They were so interested
that they had quite forgotten the hour until
Virginia heard the galloping of horses’ feet, and
springing up, she exclaimed, “Why, Megsy, it is 9
o’clock and we aren’t ready for our ride.” Then she
called out of the open window, “Thank you, Slim,
for bringing up the horses. You may leave them
there. We’ll be out in short order.” Then turning
to Margaret, she added, “What are you going to
wear, Megsy?”</p>

<p>The Eastern girl laughingly held up a black
broadcloth riding habit with a long tailored coat
and a stiff black derby. “This doesn’t look much
like a cowgirl costume,” she said gaily. “How I
do wish I had a khaki suit like yours.”</p>

<p>“So you shall have as soon as we can get to town,
but today you may wear my extra one. I always
keep two in readiness least a mishap befall one of
them. I’ll get it in a twinkling.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the girls were starting on their
ride across the desert and toward the Slater Ranch.
Margaret, in her cowgirl costume, made a very
pretty picture. “How I wish Babs could see me
now!” she said as the two girls, after a canter side
by side, drew rein to go single file down the steep
trail leading across Silver Creek which at that time
of the year was dry and pebbly.</p>

<p>Virginia glanced anxiously at Comrade for that
pony seemed restive and ill content. “Was it because
of the strangeness of the rider?” the girl wondered.
She was about to suggest that Margaret
hold the rein loosely when the level desert was again
reached, but at that moment a sudden whirlwind
swept toward them and they were engulfed in blinding
sand.</p>

<p>Margaret, terrorized by this new and unexpected
experience, dragged frantically on the rein. Instantly
Comrade reared, and then, dropping again to all
fours, he galloped madly ahead at a pace so rapid
that Virginia, though she urged Star to his top-most
speed, could not overtake him.</p>

<p>Margaret knew that her only safety lay in clinging
to the horse’s neck and this she did, dropping
the rein which flapping in Comrade’s face greatly
increased his fright. Although Virginia’s pony
strained every muscle, he could not overtake the
fright-maddened Comrade. Now and then pausing
to snort and rear, again plunging blindly ahead,
the red-brown pony suddenly veered and made
straight for the mountains. There was a new terror
in the heart of Virginia and she greatly feared for
the safety of her friend, for the mountain trail
was rough and the Eastern girl would surely be
thrown against the jagged rocks.</p>

<p>Then, to add to Virginia’s dismay, a second
whirlwind swept across the desert. She saw it coming
and just in time, she wheeled Star about that the
sand might not be hurled in their faces. When the
air was again clear Comrade and his rider were
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>What had happened, Virginia wondered, sad at
heart. Surely they could not have reached the mountain
trail as yet. Of course the rider might have
been thrown, but the horse, too, had disappeared.</p>

<p>Again urging Star to his top speed, Virginia soon
neared the spot where she had last seen Comrade.
There she drew rein and looked about.</p>

<p>“Margaret! Margaret!” she called. “Where are
you?” But there was no reply.</p>

<p>With a half sob Virginia turned her horse’s head,
planning to ride to the Slater Ranch for help, when
she heard a faint moan. It seemed to come from a
thorny tangle of bushes that surrounded a deep
waterhole. For one terrorized moment Virginia
thought that her friend might have been hurled into
this stagnant well of the desert. Dismounting she
ran to the spot, but, to her great relief, Margaret,
although she was lying on the sand, had not been
thrown into the pit.</p>

<p>Kneeling by the side of her friend, who was pale
and motionless, Virginia pleaded: “Megsy, Megsy,
darling. Open your eyes and speak to me. Are you
hurt?” But there was no response.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I permit her to ride Comrade?”
Virginia rebuked herself, as she held the limp girl
in her arms and tried to revive her by rubbing her
hands and forehead, but still there was no sign of
life. Rising, she went to the edge of the well, but
the little water that was in it was covered with a
green scum. What could she do? If only she
could send to Slater’s for help, but she must not
go herself and leave Margaret alone. She would
have to send Star. It was their one hope. Going
to the waiting pony, Virginia tied her bright red
hair ribbon on the saddle horn and started him in
the direction of the nearest ranch, but to her despair,
she saw the pony wander toward a clump of
wiry grass and stop to graze.</p>

<p>At that moment, although Virginia had no way
of knowing it, help was not far away.</p>

<p>It seemed hours to Virginia, but in reality not
many minutes had passed when she heard a galloping
of what seemed like the feet of many horses.
Leaping from the sand where she had been kneeling
beside Margaret the girl stood waiting for she knew
not what. The sound came from beyond a small
sand hill. It might be a stampede of little wild
burros, she thought, but how she did hope that this
surmise was wrong, as indeed it was, for in another
moment three horses appeared and the one in
the lead was ridden by the Slater cow-boy known
as “Slick Cy.” Meekly following were the now
quieted Comrade and Star.</p>

<p>Virginia scarcely knowing what she did in her
great joy and relief, ran to meet the cow-boy with
arms outstretched. “Oh, Cy! Cy!” she half sobbed,
“I’m so glad you have come. Margaret has been
thrown and she lies as still as though she were
dead, and yet I know that she isn’t, for her heart
is beating, but I can’t revive her. I’ll never go anywhere
again without my canteen. Cy, what shall we
do?”</p>

<p>The bronzed, broad-shouldered cow-boy dismounted,
and, looking kindly at the almost hysterical
girl, he said comfortingly, “Ah reckon ah
wouldn’t worry yet, Miss Virginia. If her heart’s
a-goin’ ah reckon she’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>Taking a canteen from his saddle the cow-boy
forced water between the lips of the girl while Virginia
bathed her face, and soon to the joy of the
watchers, Margaret opened her eyes. Then she
reached out her hand to her friend as she said faintly,
“It was all mv fault, Virginia, dear. I should
have told you that I did not know how to ride, really.
I had never been on a horse, except one that nothing
could frighten, but you are such a fine horsewoman
I thought you might think me a coward if I told
you that I was really afraid to ride Comrade, but
I’ll never ride him again, never, never, never.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart leaped with joy, for after all she
would not have to give up the horse she so loved,
the one her dear father had given her for her very,
very own.</p>

<p>“Star is far more gentle,” she said, as she and Cy
assisted Margaret to her feet, then remembering her
manners, she added, “Margaret, permit me to introduce
Slick Cy. He is one of Mr. Slater’s cow-boys.”</p>

<p>Impulsively Margaret held out her hand as she
said graciously, “Thank you, Mr. Slick Cy, for coming
to my rescue.”</p>

<p>The young giant of a cow-boy, being unused to
girls, was very shy and he shifted from one foot
to another as he said, “Miss Margaret, ah reckon
as you’d better ride home with me on my horse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, Megsy,” Virginia urged. “It won’t be
safe for you to even ride Star until you have had
a few lessons.”</p>

<p>Margaret smiled at her friend as she remarked:
“Now I have an adventure about which I can tell
Babs in my very next letter.”</p>

<h2 title='THE DESERT HUT' id='chXIII'>
CHAPTER XIII—THE DESERT HUT.
</h2>

<p>It was the nineteenth of December and the morning
was bright and sparkling. Margaret Selover
stood on the wide veranda of the ranch house, her
eyes glowing with appreciation as she gazed across
the shimmering white desert and toward the mountains
over which hung a blaze of blue and gold.</p>

<p>“Ho, Virginia,” she called to the girl, who, hatless,
came up from the chicken yard, where she had
been to scatter a breakfast to her feathered pets,
“it is hard for me to realize that it is nearly Christmas
and not a snow flake to be seen.”</p>

<p>“When we go up in the mountains after our
Christmas tree, you will see plenty of snow,” Virginia
assured her. “Slim tells me that when he rode
over the Seven Peak range yesterday, it was snowing
and blowing a regular blizzard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Virg, how nice! Are we going to have a
truly Christmas tree? I haven’t had one since
mother and dad and I were all together.”</p>

<p>The other girl nodded. “Yes, indeed. We have
a big tree every Christmas for our own family and
for the Slaters. One year we have it here and the
next to the Bar S Ranch. That makes quite a party,
for they have four cow-boys and we have two.”
Then after a thoughtful moment, Virginia added,
“How I do wish that some kiddies lived nearby. It
would be heaps more fun to have children to skip
around a Christmas tree wouldn’t it, but there isn’t
a chick or child for ten miles around.”</p>

<p>At that moment Malcolm appeared. “Sis,” he
said, “I have an important letter to send. Would
you and Margaret be willing to ride over to the junction
and mail it for me? I had planned going myself,
but Mr. Slater just phoned that he saw several
of our prize yearlings headed for the Mexican border,
and so Rusty and I are going at once to search
for them and turn them back, for, if they cross the
line, we will never see them again. If we aren’t
home tonight, don’t worry, girls, for we will camp
down that way until we find them all.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye and good luck!” Margaret and Virginia
called, as arm in arm they stood watching the
good looking boy as he swung into his saddle and
galloped away. Near the corral he was joined by
Rusty Pete and the two boys turned and waved
their wide sombreros while Malcolm’s horse reared
and then plunged ahead, to the delight of the eastern
girl. “How I do hope Babs will see Malcolm ride
some day,” she said as they turned into the house.</p>

<p>Several weeks had passed since Margaret had
attempted to ride Comrade, and Malcolm had taken
every opportunity that presented since then to teach
his ward to ride, and at last both gracefully and
fearlessly she rode every day with Virginia.</p>

<p>Half an hour after Malcolm had departed, the
two girls in their khaki riding habits (Margaret
with a red handkerchief knotted about her neck
and Virginia with a blue) started riding along the
trail which led over the mesa, down into the dry
creek and over toward the mountains. They were
about a quarter of a mile away from the Seven Peak
range when Virginia suddenly drew rein and gazed
intently ahead. Margaret looked wonderingly in the
same direction but saw nothing unusual.</p>

<p>“What is it, Virginia?” the eastern girl asked
anxiously as she drew rein by the side of her friend
and gazed across the shimmering desert.</p>

<p>“Has something startled you? What do you see?”</p>

<p>Margaret knew that Virginia’s desert trained
eyes could perceive things that were invisible to her.
“It may be nothing at all to be startled about,” Virginia
replied, “but I overheard two cow-boys talking
yesterday. One of them had just ridden in from
Douglas and he said that an outlaw from Texas is
hiding in the mountains. I did not mention this to
brother, for, had I done so, he would not permit me
to ride far from the house, and I am very sure
that we can protect ourselves. However, I do not
wish to run into trouble needlessly.”</p>

<p>“But what did you see that made you think this
outlaw might be near?” Margaret inquired.</p>

<p>Virginia turned toward her. “You, too, must train
your eyes,” she said. “Now look intently just to
the left of the giant cactus, and close to the foot
of the mountains; then tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>Margaret shaded her eyes and gazed for a long
time before she spoke. “I think that I can see an
old adobe hut,” she said softly. Then she asked,
“Is that what you wished me to see?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded. “Yes, but what do you notice
about it?”</p>

<p>“There might be smoke coming from the chimney,”
Margaret replied, “but it is so faint that at
first I did not notice it.”</p>

<p>“When I tell you that the old crumbling adobe
has been vacant for many years and that it is absolutely
unsafe as a habitation for human beings of
any kind, you will understand why I was so puzzled
to see signs of an occupant. The last family to live
there was a mountain lioness and her young, but I
am sure that some human being must be there
now, for a lion could not start a fire.”</p>

<p>Virginia, fearing that she might have frightened
the eastern girl, said this merrily as she whirled her
horse’s head away from the mountains.</p>

<p>“We will take the sand hill trail,” she announced.
“It is a mile farther to the junction, but perhaps we
would be unwise to ride alone too close to the old
adobe.”</p>

<p>“You really think that the outlaw might be hiding
there?” Margaret asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Virginia nodded. “It is a very lonely spot,” she
said, “and so it is quite possible.”</p>

<p>“What is an outlaw?” the eastern girl inquired
as they rode side by side toward the sand-hills.</p>

<p>“An outlaw is a man who has done something
displeasing to his fellow citizens. He is driven from
his home state and it would not be safe for him to
return. Sometimes an outlaw is innocent of the
charges against him and is just a victim of unfortunate
circumstances, but one never knows, of
course.”</p>

<p>Virginia, as she spoke, glanced back toward the
old adobe which was hardly visible from that distance;
then, to Margaret’s surprise, she drew rein,
whirled about and once more gazed intently in that
direction.</p>

<p>“Virg, what do you see now?” Margaret inquired,
for she herself could see nothing.</p>

<p>For answer Virginia beckoned the eastern girl
to follow, and then, urging Comrade to top speed,
she again galloped toward the mountains and the
old adobe hut.</p>

<p>Much puzzled, Margaret followed on Star.</p>

<p>What had Virginia seen, she wondered.</p>

<h2 title='THE HUT OCCUPIED' id='chXIV'>
CHAPTER XIV—THE HUT OCCUPIED.
</h2>

<p>Virginia did not pause in her mad gallop over
the hard, sandy trail toward the mountains until
they were near enough for Margaret’s untrained
eyes to see clearly the old adobe. Then, turning in
her saddle, the western girl asked: “What do you
see now?”</p>

<p>“Something white waving on the roof,” the
eastern girl replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the something is being waved by a
small boy, and so the occupant is not an outlaw as
we feared at first. I believe that the little fellow is
trying to call for help.” Then gazing intently at
her comrade, Virginia said: “Margaret, I will ride
on alone, and you remain here. It may be a trap
laid for us, but still it may be someone in trouble.
I cannot pass without knowing which it is.”</p>

<p>“But, Virginia,” the Eastern girl pleaded, “I
wouldn’t want to remain here and let you go alone
into possible danger.”</p>

<p>“Margaret,” the other said earnestly, “you would
be a far greater help to me if you would wait here.
If it is a trap, and if I do not quickly reappear,
gallop as fast as you can back to the ranch and bring
Slim to my rescue, but if all is well I will wave to
you and then you may come to the hut in safety.”</p>

<p>Margaret felt that Virginia was planning this to
protect her, and her heart was filled with conflicting
emotions as she sat on Star watching as the western
girl rode alone toward the crumbling adobe hut.
The boy was no longer on the roof, nor was there
smoke coming from the chimney. A vulture, sweeping
in great circles overhead, was the only sign of
life.</p>

<p>Margaret fairly held her breath when she saw
Virginia dismount and enter the open door. Would
she come out again? What would she find in there?
Margaret shuddered at these thoughts.</p>

<p>One minute passed, then two, and Virginia did
not appear. Ought Margaret to race to the ranch
for help? Another minute, which seemed an hour
long to the waiting girl, and then, to her great relief,
Virginia appeared in the open door and beckoned
to her. By her side was the small boy who
had been on the roof.</p>

<p>As Margaret rode up, Virginia hastened out to
meet her and there were tears in the eyes that were
lifted to her friend.</p>

<p>“What is it, Virginia? Is someone in trouble?”
Margaret asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, in great trouble,” was the reply. “A
little mother is lying in there, unconscious, and the
three babies, the oldest but nine, are almost starved.
Oh, how thankful I am that we did not pass them
by.” Then, brushing away her tears, she added:
“Margaret, dear, please ride home as fast as you
can and ask Slim to come at once with the car. I
will take this little family back to the ranch.”</p>

<p>Margaret did as she was told, and was soon riding
as she had never ridden before. Suddenly she
saw a horseman appear on the sand hill trail. He
was riding slowly when she first noticed him, but
upon seeing her, he urged his horse to a gallop.
Margaret was terrorized! What if it should be
that dreaded outlaw? She tried to urge Star to
greater speed, but although she did not turn, she
could tell that the horseman was overtaking her.</p>

<p>A few moments later, when the galloping tread
of the pursuing horse was close behind her, the
eastern girl, drew rein and whirled about that she
might know the worst or the best, and it sure was
the latter for the supposed “outlaw” was no other
than Slick Cy, the kindly cow-boy from the Slater
Ranch.</p>

<p>“Miss Margaret,” he exclaimed as he rode alongside,
“yo’ all look scared like. Didn’t yo’ all know
who ah was?”</p>

<div id='004' class='mt10 mb10 w004'>
  <img src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>She tried to urge Star to greater speed for the horseman was overtaking her.</p>
</div>

<p>“No, I didn’t ever think that it might be you, Cy,
but Oh, how glad I am that you have come, for
something terrible has happened.” And then the
girl hurriedly told of the sick woman and the nearly
starved children whom Virginia had found in the
crumbling old adobe.</p>

<p>“They all must be strangers hereabouts,” the cow-boy
said, then he added: “It’s well I met up with
yo’, Miss Margaret, for Slim is riding north to the
Dartly Ranch. Ah passed him this hour back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do, then?” Margaret dolefully
exclaimed. “Virginia told me to send Slim to
her at once with the car. How I wish now that I
had learned to drive, but all I can do is start a
car and stop it.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” said the cow-boy hopefully, “if yo’ all
can start it, like as not ah can steer it, and then
Miss Virginia can be drivin’ it back.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were down by the corral
and the big automobile was taken from its shelter.
Then, with many misgivings, Margaret told Slick
Cy what to do and they started so suddenly that
the girl feared that they would plunge down into
the dry creek before the machine could be controlled,
but, although Slick Cy knew much more about the
management of wild horses, by following Margaret’s
directions, he was soon driving slowly and
the danger of a wreck was passed, for the present,
at least.</p>

<p>Virginia saw them coming and hurried out to
meet them. “Why, Slick Cy,” she exclaimed, when
the car stopped, “I didn’t know that you could
drive.”</p>

<p>The cow-boy drew out a big, red bandana and
wiped his flushed face.</p>

<p>“He did splendidly,” Margaret put in before the
cow-boy could reply. “I am so thankful he happened
along, for Slim has ridden over to the Dartley
Ranch.”</p>

<p>They were walking toward the old adobe as they
talked and when they entered the dark, damp room
Margaret glanced at the hard board bench and saw
a frail little woman lying there so white and still
that the girl feared she had died while she had
been gone. Nearby stood a hollow-eyed boy of 9,
and, on the floor, clinging to each other were two
small girls of about 3 and 5.</p>

<p>The younger one was crying softly, but the older
girl looked as though she had suffered and starved
so much that she could cry no more.</p>

<p>Slick Cy took off his hat. “How came the pore
things here, Miss Virginia?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The little lad has told me the whole sad story,”
that girl replied, “and I will tell it to you when the
brave little mother is cared for. Cy, can you carry
her to the car?”</p>

<p>For answer the young giant of a cow-boy stooped
and lifted the frail woman, who moaned but did
not open her eyes.</p>

<p>Soon they were all in the car, which Virginia
drove slowly and skillfully toward the V. M. Ranch.</p>

<h2 title='THE STRANDED FAMILY' id='chXV'>
CHAPTER XV—THE STRANDED FAMILY.
</h2>

<p>Back of the big, rambling V. M. ranch house
there was a comfortable small adobe which had been
occupied at one time by the foreman and family,
but now that Malcolm was his own foreman, the
house was vacant, and it was into this that Virginia
bade Cy carry the little woman.</p>

<p>Then Virginia held out her hand as she said sincerely:
“Thank you Cy, for having helped us again.
Isn’t it strange that twice, when we have needed
someone, you have just happened to pass by.”</p>

<p>The cow-boy flushed as he replied, shuffling from
one foot to the other. “Yo’ all have done mo’ for
me than ah can be doin’ fo’ you-all. Ah’m glad
ah meet up wi’-you-all.” Then he turned and bolted.
No other word would adequately describe his manner
of disappearance.</p>

<p>“That boy is a diamond in the rough, isn’t he?”
Margaret said as she stood in the open-door and
watched the tall lank cow-boy swing into his saddle
and ride away toward the Slater Ranch.</p>

<p>Virginia, having for years helped care for an
invalid mother, soon had the little woman roused from
her stupor and taking warm broth for nourishment.
Margaret, in the meantime, fed the three
solemn eyed children who ate ravenously, like little
wild creatures that were nearly starved.</p>

<p>At last when the mother had fallen into a more
natural sleep and the three children had been tucked
into one large bed, the two girls seated themselves
near the kitchen stove in which Virg had made a
fire and Megsy said: “Now may I hear what happened
to bring this little brood to the desert?”</p>

<p>“It is not a long story,” Virginia began, “nor an
unusual one. The father of the small family is a
prospector who, until recently, was working in a
copper mine near Bisbee. They had a good home
and plenty to eat, little Pat said, until the strike
came and then their money had to be taken from
the savings bank where the mother had been so
glad each month to place it and had been used for
absolute necessities until, at last, it was nearly gone.</p>

<p>“Then, one day, the father, who had tried in vain
to get work of any kind, came home much excited
because he had heard that the mountains of the
Seven Peak Range were supposed to be rich and as
yet they had been unmined. He wanted to start out
that very day. His wife, Mrs. Mahoy, begged him
not to go, but Margaret, when a miner thinks that
he has heard of a possible location that might be
rich, his gambling spirit seems to be stronger than
all else, and so just one month ago today Mr. Mahoy
left Bisbee and came, as his wife supposed, to Seven
Peak Range.</p>

<p>“She had not heard from him since, and so she
started out in search of him, spending the few remaining
dollars for food. Carrying the baby and
leading the two older children, the brave little woman
walked for days across the desert.</p>

<p>“Pat said that she ate almost nothing herself, so
eager was she to make the food last for her little
ones, but for two days even they had not eaten. Last
night they reached the old adobe hut and there the
mother, faint from hunger and the long walk, crept
in and fell unconscious.</p>

<p>“You know the rest; how the brave little fellow
tried to think of some way that he might call help
and how, just by chance, we saw and responded.”
Margaret, by the window, looked out across the
desert. Night had settled down and the stars were
shining brilliantly.</p>

<p>“One week from tonight it will be Christmas
eve,” she said softly, “How I wish we might find
the poor father and restore him to his family. What
happiness it would bring, for no other Christmas
gift would be more welcome to the little mother
and her three babies.”</p>

<p>“Such things only happen in story books, not in
real life, Megsy dear,” Virginia said, quietly.</p>

<p>“And yet truth is stranger than fiction.” Margaret
replied as she prepared the bed that she and
Virginia were to occupy in the little house that
they might be near the sick mother.</p>

<p>And Margaret was right. Truth is stranger than
fiction.</p>

<h2 title='CAUGHT IN A BLIZZARD' id='chXVI'>
CHAPTER XVI—CAUGHT IN A BLIZZARD.
</h2>

<p>Three days had passed and the little mother had
responded to the loving care of the two girls. Nourishing
food taken each hour had revived her and
slowly she was regaining her strength. She was
able to walk about the little house and care for her
babies. Virginia assured her that she need worry
about nothing; that she and her children would
be well cared for as long as she wished to remain
there.</p>

<p>The frail woman took the girl’s hand and with
tears in her eyes she said: “You are one of God’s
angels sent to save my babies and now may He
guide my husband back to me.”</p>

<p>“He will! I know He will, Mrs. Mahoy,” Virginia
said earnestly. Then hearing the telephone
ringing in the big ranch house, she ran to answer
it. Margaret had also heard the summons and the
two girls met on the veranda. Together they raced
to the living-room, but it was Virginia who first
reached the phone. “Oh, Brother Malcolm,” she
exclaimed, “Where have you been all these three
days? I feared that you had been dragged over the
border by Mexican bandits. Have you found all of
the straying cattle?”</p>

<p>Then after listening with shining eyes for a moment,
Virginia exclaimed: “Oh, goodie. We’ll come
at once. I have a very exciting something to tell
you, but it will keep till we get there. Good-bye,
Buddie.”</p>

<p>“Guess what Malcolm wants us to do?” she then
exclaimed as she looked beamingly up at Margaret.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I judge that he wants us to ride
somewhere and meet him for some reason which
seems pleasing to his sister.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed. “You ought to know what
we are to do if you will put on your thinking cap.
Do you remember what I said brother and I do
every year just before Christmas?”</p>

<p>Margaret looked blank and shook her head. “Why,
we were talking about it only last week when you
said you wished that you could see snow and—”</p>

<p>“Oho! I know now. We are to meet Malcolm
somewhere and go up into the mountains after a
Christmas tree.” Then she added blithely: “Virginia,
do you remember that on that very same day
you wished that we might have a child to dance
around the Christmas tree and now we have three
children, and so it will be heaps more fun, won’t
it?”</p>

<p>As the girls chattered, they entered their bedrooms
to exchange their house dresses for their
khaki riding habits.</p>

<p>“There’s little Pat on the cow-pony that you told
him he might ride,” Margaret said, looking out of
the window.</p>

<p>“I will ask him if he would like to go with us,”
Virginia remarked. The little lad was delighted to
accompany the two girls, and half an hour later
the three were riding along the desert trail toward
the Slater Ranch, where they were to meet Malcolm.</p>

<p>“I just love Christmas, don’t you, Virg?” Margaret
exclaimed, when, the deep dry creek having
been crossed, the girls were cantering along on the
hard sand side by side. “It’s such fun to get packages
by mail and then put them away to keep until
Christmas. Of course I know just where they are,
and every now and then I peek at them and try to
guess from the shape what is in them, but I am
strong-minded about it. I never do really open
them until Christmas morning, do you?”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed. “I’ll have to confess that last
year I opened a long, mysterious box the moment it
arrived. I was so eager to see if it was the something
that I wanted most, and it was.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” the other asked with interest.</p>

<p>“A set of grey fox furs,” Virginia replied.
“Brother shot the fox in the early winter and I
had said what an adorable set of furs could be made
from the skin. Well, I noticed that it disappeared
from Buddie’s room, but I wasn’t real sure what
had become of it until that box arrived from the
town furrier.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the girls noticed that the little Irish boy
riding near was listening with wide-eyed interest.</p>

<p>“Well, Little Pat,” Margaret said gaily, “a penny
for your thoughts.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Virginia,” was the reply, “Christmas
presents don’t come on the train. Weren’t you after
knowin’ that it’s the good St. Nick as brings them?”</p>

<p>“Of course, dearie,” Virginia hastened to say, “I
know it is the good St. Nick who brings presents
to children, but we grown folks sometimes give gifts
to each other. Ho! look ahead! Megsy,” she added.
“There’s Brother Malcolm waiting for us at the Big
Boulder, and good! Slick Cy is with him.”</p>

<p>The latter cow-boy had told Malcolm all about the
poor family that Virginia had rescued, and he was
eager to assure his sister that she had done just as
he would have wished her to do had he been there.</p>

<p>After the merry greetings had been exchanged,
Virginia exclaimed “Where are we to go for a
Christmas tree, Slick Cy?”</p>

<p>“Ah saw a beauty tree last week, high on Second
Peak trail,” that cow-boy drawled. Then he looked
anxiously at the sky. “Looks sort of to me like
thar might be a blizzard. If so, ’twouldn’t be safe
nohow fo’ you gurls to ride up that trail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, let us go,” Margaret begged. “I’m
wild to see a pine tree growing up in the mountains.
I don’t believe a storm is coming, do you, Malcolm?”</p>

<p>That boy looked toward the north where threatening
clouds were rapidly gathering.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Slick Cy is right,” he said. “Perhaps
we ought to give up the idea of getting the tree today.”</p>

<p>“But, brother, there is only one day more before
Christmas and we need that to trim the tree
and get ready for the party,” Virginia protested.</p>

<p>“Well, like as not it may blow over,” Slick Cy
said, really against his better judgment. “If we are
a-goin’, we’d better get started.”</p>

<p>And so with the Slater cow-boy in the lead and
Malcolm in the rear, the little procession started up
the steep trail. But they had not gone far when
Slick Cy whirled in his saddle and held up a warning
hand. Malcolm had also heard the low ominous
sound which seemed to be gathering in volume as
though whatever caused it, with each second, was
drawing nearer.</p>

<p>“What is it?” the eastern girl inquired, looking
from one startled face to another.</p>

<p>“It’s the blizzard I dreaded,” Malcolm replied.
“Cy, what shall we do? Just ahead of us the trail
is exposed. How I do wish that we had insisted
upon the girls returning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, brother,” Virginia exclaimed “we will return
at once if you think best.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late now,” the lad replied. “Quick,
jump from your horses and follow me. There is
a small cave near here and in it you will be protected
from the storm.”</p>

<p>A moment later the two girls and small boy were
huddled in the cave, and none too soon, for a blinding
hurricane of snow and hail surged past. The
two cow-boys had succeeded in leading the ponies
into a shelter of brush and rock. Luckily the storm
was of short duration and it was followed by a
gleaming blue sky. But Malcolm would not permit
the girls to ride higher up a trail which he knew
might be dangerous at that time of the year, and so,
reluctantly, they agreed to return to V. M. Ranch
after having received the promise from the cow-boys
that they would surely bring a tree by nightfall
that the girls would have time to trim it and
have it in readiness for the joyful Christmas day.</p>

<p>Little Pat was very proud indeed when Malcolm
placed a hand on his shoulder and said in his kind,
comrady manner: “Laddie, you will take good care
of the young ladies won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Shure, sir, I’ll be doin’ me best,” the Irish boy
declared, and the girls laughed to themselves as
they rode down the trail, for often the little fellow
looked back anxiously to be sure that all was well
with them.</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed not to see our Christmas tree
growing in its mountain home,” Margaret said
when they were cantering across the level desert
trail toward V. M., “but I was so frightened when
the storm surged by that I would not care to be
caught in another.”</p>

<p>“Such storms high on the mountains are very frequent
at this time of the year,” Virginia told her
friend, then she added: “How I do hope the boys
will be able to find the big tree that Cy saw last
week.”</p>

<p>Even as Virg spoke, high up in the mountains,
the two boys had found something, but it was not a
Christmas tree.</p>

<h2 title='CHRISTMAS EVE' id='chXVII'>
CHAPTER XVII—CHRISTMAS EVE.
</h2>

<p>It was Christmas Eve. Slick Cy and Malcolm
had returned toward nightfall with a fine tree, to
the delight of the girls, who had it erected in the
big living-room, where they spent a merry hour covering
its branches with shining ornaments.</p>

<p>Virginia and Margaret were happily excited.
“Virg,” Megsy exclaimed, “don’t you think that
Malcolm and Slick Cy act as though they have a secret
that they don’t wish us to know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have noticed it,” Virginia said as she
stood on a chair to place a tiny doll on the top-most
bough. “What do you suppose it can be?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have a present for us,” Margaret
replied. Then she added: “I keep thinking of poor
Babs and wishing that she was with us.”</p>

<p>“Why poor? I thought you said that Babs has
a good income.” Virginia held a toy horse as she
glanced inquiringly at her friend.</p>

<p>“Babs is always so sad at the holiday time,” Margaret
explained. “She tries to seem cheerful but
there is such a lonely, wistful expression in her eyes
and then once she told me that Christmas had never
been a happy season for her since her brother Peyton
left home.”</p>

<p>“I, too, say ‘poor Babs,’” Virginia said earnestly.
“I do indeed wish that she were here. Now, dear,
if you will give me that taper I will light the candles.”</p>

<p>Margaret did this and then stepped back. “How
pretty the tree looks with all those sparkling ornaments,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it?” Virginia had joined her friend.
Then as she blew out the light of the taper she added:
“One of the boys is to play Santa Claus—I
don’t know which one—but brother told me to have
Mrs. Mahoy and the kiddies over here promptly
at seven o’clock. Since it is ten minutes to that
hour I’ll skip over to their house and call them.”</p>

<p>A moment later the three shining-eyed Irish
children burst into the room and the older girls
could not have found little ones more willing to skip
and dance about their tree, for how those small Mahoys
did squeal and clap their hands and hop for
joy!</p>

<p>“See ’ittle dollies way up top!” Baby Cola lisped
as she tried to drag her pale, sad-eyed mother over
toward the tree. The older girls looked at the little
woman and their hearts ached for her, for well they
knew that there could be no real happiness for her
unless she could find her lost husband.</p>

<p>“Everybody be seated, quick!” Margaret called
as the clock struck 7. “Santa will be coming now.”</p>

<p>Such a scramble as there was for chairs, and then,
“Oh! Oh! See Santa!” Baby Cola and 5-year-old
Dora cried in excited chorus. The dining-room
had opened to admit someone dressed to represent
the good old saint. Margaret and Virginia stared
for a moment, uncomprehending, for this apparition
was not of the build of either Slick Cy or Malcolm,
both of whom were broad-shouldered young giants.
The Santa Claus, however, evidently had been told
what to do, for, after making a fine bow he straightway
reached to the highest branch, and taking down
the dollies, he called: “For Baby Cola.”</p>

<p>Right at that moment something surprising happened.
A glad light brightened the face of the little
woman, and, springing up, she ran with outstretched
arms toward the supposed Santa Claus, who caught
her in an embrace that told the tenderness of his
love for her.</p>

<p>“It’s me Pat!”, the little woman sobbed. “Me
Pat that I’ve wanted so.” Snatching off his disguise
the happy Irishman gathered his little ones in his
arms. A moment later Malcolm and Slick Cy appeared,
and going to the amazed girls, the former
said:</p>

<p>“Our Santa Claus is not much better at play-actin’
than is dear old Uncle Tex.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Virginia exclaimed, with tears
in her eyes. “He couldn’t disguise his voice so that
his loving little wife wouldn’t recognize it, but how
did he come here? Where did you find him?”</p>

<p>The boys then told how they had found the prospector
living alone in a cabin high on Second Peak,
close to the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>“And think of it, sister,” Malcolm exclaimed excitedly.
“He has truly found a paying mine, and
if you and I will grubstake him, he’ll let us go
shares and there’s no telling but that we may all be
rich some day.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before the excitement had subsided
so that they could proceed with the merry program
as it had been planned, and never before had
that old roof covered so many happy hearts.</p>

<p>The week following Christmas was filled with
many events on the V. M. Ranch.</p>

<p>Malcolm, who was greatly interested in the finding
of the mine on Second Peak conferred for several
hours with his sister, and finally decided that
together they would grubstake Pat Mahoy in the
venture.</p>

<p>The next day the three men rode away, leaving
the girls to wait anxiously Malcolm’s decision when
he himself had examined the prospective mine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mahoy and her small brood were to remain
in the adobe house indefinitely if they wished. The
little woman was no longer sad, and the three
children added much to the joyfulness of the Christmas
season.</p>

<p>“Oh, Virginia!” Margaret exclaimed when they
turned into the ranch house after having waved
farewell to Malcolm, Slick Cy and Mr. Mahoy. “I
am so eager to receive our Christmas mail, but no
one has been to town in ever so long. I just know
that there will be a box for me from Babs. We
have exchanged presents every year and I am sure
that she has sent me something. How are we going
to get the mail?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if Slim rode in today
or tomorrow,” Virginia said. “You know he
has been for a week at a round-up just beyond the
Junction. If he does come, he will stop for the
mail.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later when Margaret went to the
veranda to shake a duster, she called excitedly:</p>

<p>“Virg, come quick. Look way up on the mesa
trail. Is that a horseman I see or is it the giant
cactus?”</p>

<p>Virginia appeared with the field glasses and after
gazing through them for a moment, she exclaimed:
“It surely is a horseman but he can’t be our Slim
for he is much too stout.”</p>

<p>But when the horseman drew near, they saw that
it really was their cow-boy. Virginia ran out to
greet him as she laughingly called, “Slim, it is no
wonder that we didn’t recognize you. Why you
bulge like a Santa Claus with all of those packages.
Megsy, do see that big box tied on back. Who is
it for, Slim?”</p>

<p>The young cow-boy looked as pleased as the jolly
old saint himself as he replied, “I cal’late its fo’ the
two of yo’, Miss Virginie. Sort o’ pears to me like
both yo’ names is writ on it.”</p>

<p>He had dismounted as he talked, and, at Virginia’s
suggestion, had carried the box into the living-room
and placed it on the big table which Megsy
had hastily cleared. The girls then filled his
pockets with goodies, for Slim had been obliged to
be away from V. M. for Christmas. “That’s our
thank you for bringing us so many presents,” Virginia
told him.</p>

<p>Then, when the cow-boy had departed for the
bunk house, the girls turned their attention to the
big mysterious looking box.</p>

<p>“What can be in it?” Margaret wondered. “Wait
till I get a hammer and chisel and we will soon
find out.” Virg skipped to the tool house but soon
returned.</p>

<p>“Of course I am sure it is from Babs,” Margaret
said as she watched with interest as her friend pried
off the cover.</p>

<p>“I think so too,” Virg affirmed. “But why my
name is also on the wrapping I cannot imagine.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that Babs put a present in for you,
too,” Margaret declared. “I have written so much
about you to my beloved roommate that she feels
well acquainted with you, and then, moreover, she
was so pleased because you invited her to visit on
the V. M. Ranch next summer.”</p>

<p>Beneath the cover there lay a dozen Christmasy
looking packages of all shapes and sizes. On each
one was a sprig of holly and mistletoe and a tag.
On some of these Virginia’s name was written and
on the others Margaret’s.</p>

<p>Megsy clapped her hands in little girl fashion as
she exclaimed merrily, “Oh, aren’t we having fun?
I only wish that Babs might see the pleasure her
surprise box is giving up. Now you choose one
of the packages and open it and then I’ll do the
same. That will make the surprise last longer.”</p>

<p>So Virginia chose a queer-shaped package and began
to untie the narrow red ribbon, but she found
whatever it was it had many wrappings. On one
of these was written, “Pause and guess what I may
be. I begin with a letter P.”</p>

<p>“If that isn’t just like Babs!” Margaret exclaimed.
“Do you suppose it is a penwiper?”</p>

<p>“No,” Virginia said as she continued to unwrap
the gift. “It feels like cardboard. Oho! Just look!
It’s the dearest photograph of Babs herself.”</p>

<p>“It’s a new one taken in her first party dress,”
Margaret exclaimed admiringly as the two heads
bent over the picture of a merry-eyed girl with
bobbed curls. “It’s the sweetest dress. She had it
made just before I left. It’s pink and all fluffy
ruffles. I’ll just be green with jealousy if Babs
hasn’t sent me one, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that you will find one,” Virginia declared
as they both peered into the surprise box
wondering which of the unopened packages contained
the wished-for photograph.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s open them as they come,” Megsy said
at last. “Babs has purposely wrapped them in queer
shapes.”</p>

<p>It took the girls a long happy hour to untie the
gifts. There were two pretty handkerchiefs, two
books, “Just Patty” and “When Patty Went to College.”
Two line-a-day diaries and two boxes of
chocolate fudge so full of nut meats that they
bulged.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind Babs makes every Saturday night
at boarding school,” Margaret said, then she
added: “Oh good! Here are two letters from my
darling room-mate, one for you and one for me.
Now we will know all the jolly news items about
Vine Haven.”</p>

<p>“You read your letter first,” Virginia said as she
piled the soft pillows back of them on the window
seat and settled down for comfortable enjoyment of
a visit with the far-away Babs.</p>

<p>“All right,” Margaret agreed as she tore open the
pale blue envelope out of which wafted to them a
faint scent of violets.</p>

<p>Then she began to read:</p>


<p class='ni mt10'>Vine Haven Seminary:</p>

<p>Dearest Megsy: Christmas without you isn’t
nearly as festive as it used to be. The girls all came
to our room just as they did last year to plan our
mid-winter party, and though it wasn’t very complimentary
to me I heartily agreed with Belle Terry
when she said that our room seemed like an empty
cage, out of which the song bird had flown. When
the girls had gone, Megsy, I just threw myself down
on your bed (no one has slept in it since you left)
and I started to cry my eyes out, when I happened
to remember what old Mrs. Tompkins, down at the
candy shop, said once, “The best way to get over
the miseries is to try to make somebody happy.”
So I sprang right up and tried to think what I could
do to add a mite of merriness to Christmas for you
and Virginia. I decided to send you a jolly surprise
box. I worked at it until long after midnight,
but please don’t tell Miss Pickle, for of course I put
the light out at 9 o’clock and waited until I was
sure that she was asleep before I lighted it again.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single gift in the box that has any
value, but I am just sure that you two girls will
enjoy opening the packages.</p>

<p>I’m so excited about something and what that
something is I will tell in my letter to Virginia.</p>

<p class='mb10'>Oh, Megsy, darling room-mate, no words of mine
can tell how I’m a yearning to see you. Merry
Christmas and happy New Year from <span class='sc'>Babs</span>.</p>


<p>“Oh, Virginia, quick, open your letter and read
the exciting news that Babs has to tell. I know
what I do hope it is,” Margaret exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>Virg had already opened her letter and so she
began at once to read:</p>


<p class='mt10'>Dear Virginia: Please let me call you that. I
am so glad that you sent me a kodak picture of
you on horseback. I just adore it! I had it enlarged
so that I could see you better, and now in
a pretty frame it hangs in my room over my writing
desk, and every time one of the girls come in she
immediately asks, “Oh Babs, who is that stunning
cowgirl?” And when I tell them who you are and
that you have invited me to visit at your ranch
home, they all just look green with envy. Of course
I don’t know yet that I may accept, but I have written
dad about it twice, and I held my breath when
a return letter came from him, but, for some reason,
he didn’t mention the subject. However, I can’t
give up hope that he will let me go. Oh, you’ll have
to excuse me a minute, Martha just came to my
door and said I am wanted in the library.</p>

<p class='mb10'>Half an hour later. It was dad at the long distance
telephone. He said he had expected to run
down to Vine Haven to wish me a Merry Christmas,
but business prevented, so he had called up instead
to give me a Christmas surprise, and girls,
what do you think it was? I’m so happy and excited
I can hardly keep my pen from dancing. Dad
says I may come next summer, as he will have to
go west on a business trip and can escort me as far
as Arizona.</p>


<p>“Whoopla!” Margaret shouted as she tossed a
pillow into the air. “Oh, I’m so glad, so glad!”</p>

<p>“I am glad, too,” Virginia said, and then the
two girls snuggled close and planned the many delightful
things that they would do when Babs came.
When at last, the chiming of the clock announced
that it was noon, they sprang up and a small folded
paper fell to the floor. Virginia picked it up. “Here
is a postscript to your letter, Megsy, that you didn’t
read,” she said, “What can be in it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope Babs isn’t saying that she can’t
come after all,” Margaret declared as she opened
the note. She glanced at its message, then read
aloud:</p>


<p class='mt10'>“Dearest Megsy: I am writing this on a separate
piece of paper, for you may not have told Virginia
about my lost brother. It is all right, dear, if you
have, for I know that she is like a sister to you and
will be to me when we become acquainted.</p>

<p>“Having my dear brother Peyton away this
Christmas has made me even more lonely for you,
for you two are the ones in all the world for whom
I most care. Of course I do love my father, but he
seems always to be mentally preoccupied somehow.
I am never real sure but that he may be troubled
with my chatter. Sometimes I wonder if his abstraction
means that he is thinking of his business,
or, if he, too, may be grieving about his lost son,
for, though Peyton may be wayward (I never knew
what he did to anger father), I do know that he
was one of the most lovable of boys and that he
would do just anything for a person for whom he
really cared. You cannot think how tender and
kind he was to our dear mother during her long last
illness. Whatever my brother did to displease our
father, I know that it was nothing really wrong.
It was the day before last New Years that they had
words. For the very first time, I believe, Peyton
defied our father, declaring that he was old enough
to decide some things for himself.</p>

<p>“The next morning, dad and I waited breakfast
for my brother, but, when he did not join us, father
sent me to call him. When I reached his room, I
saw at once that his bed had not been slept in and
that all of his clothes were gone. I shall never forget
the desolate feeling that was in my heart when
I saw that dark empty closet and knew that my dear
brother had run away. When I went back, I was
afraid to tell father, but of course I had to. His
anger was terrible.</p>

<p>“‘Barbara,’ he said sternly, ‘your brother is dead
to us from this day forever more. Do not again
mention his name in my presence.’</p>

<p>“I never have, but Megsy, my brother is not dead
to me, and if only I could learn his whereabouts, I
would make any sacrifice.</p>

<p class='mb10'>“Now this is what I wanted to tell you. I always
suspected that he ran away to sea, for he began
wanting to be a sailor when he was a very little boy.
Yesterday I received a picture postcard from China.
There was no message on it and the address was
blurred, but it might have been his handwriting.
Oh, Megsy, I would be the happiest girl in the
world if I could be sure that Peyton sent it, for, at
least, it would mean that he is well. I wanted to
tell someone, and you are the only friend to whom
I ever mention my brother’s name. What do you
think about it? Your, <span class='sc'>Bab</span>.”</p>


<p>“Poor girl,” Virginia said, “I, too, have a dear
brother and so I know just how lonely and sad
Babs is. We must try to cheer her up, Megsy, when
she visits us.”</p>

<h2 title='THE SECRET CODE' id='chXIX'>
CHAPTER XIX—THE SECRET CODE.
</h2>

<p>The next morning the two girls were up with the
sun. “I feel as though something unusual is going
to happen today,” Virginia said as she poured the
coffee and smiled over at Margaret.</p>

<p>“So do I,” that maiden replied as she turned the
toast when it was just the right crispy brown. “I
keep thinking and thinking of poor Babs. Here it
is only the first of January and she can’t come to
visit us until the middle of June.”</p>

<p>“You will be surprised, Megsy, how quickly the
time will pass,” Virginia declared and then they
talked of Peyton, wondering what had become of
him.</p>

<p>“If he is a happy-go-lucky, tender-hearted, easily
led sort of a boy,” Virg said, “I am afraid that, being
angered by his father, he may do many things
that he might regret, perhaps when it is too late.”</p>

<p>“It is the not really knowing that makes it so
hard for Babs,” Margaret said. “If she knew even
the worst, she could face it more bravely.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden exclamation from the western
girl who had chanced to glance out of the wide
window and over the sandy stretch of desert that
was glistening in the early sunshine.</p>

<p>“A horse and rider are coming at top speed,” she
said. “How I do hope that Malcolm is returning.”</p>

<p>The girls went out on the veranda and stood arm
in arm awaiting the coming of, they knew not whom.
As the rider neared, Virginia, looking through her
glasses exclaimed: “Oh, it is only Pasqual, a small
Mexican boy whose father is one of the Slater
Range riders. Perhaps he is on his way to the Junction.
If so, he will turn at Dry Creek and ride up
the mesa trail.”</p>

<p>They watched a moment in silence and then Virginia
remarked: “He didn’t turn and so he must
be coming here. How I hope that he has a message
from Malcolm. Brother has been away for three
days now and I haven’t heard a word. I cannot
help feeling troubled if I do not hear at least that
often. So many dangers lurk on a desert, and now,
added to them, is that outlaw who is supposed to be
hiding in our mountains.”</p>

<p>The girls went out on the veranda as the small
boy approached. He removed his gayly adorned
peaked hat and took from it a letter, which he
handed to Virginia. That girl had a box of Christmas
candy which she had caught up from the table
as she passed and this she gave the dark eyed little
boy whose white teeth gleamed as he smiled his
pleasure.</p>

<p>Then thanking Virginia in his own musical language,
his pony galloped away. Virginia glanced
at the folded paper. “Why, this isn’t Malcolm’s
handwriting after all,” she exclaimed in dismay.
“Oh Megsy, I do hope that nothing has happened to
my darling brother.”</p>

<p>They went indoors, but Virginia’s anxiety was
quickly changed to mirth, and her merry laughter
rang out.</p>

<p>“Virg, what is it that amuses you?” Megsy asked,
truly puzzled. “I thought a moment ago that you
were troubled.”</p>

<p>Without answering, Virginia led her friend toward
a big desk in a sunny corner and sat down in
the swinging chair that had been her father’s. “Sit
near me,” she then said. “I have a task ahead of
me.” Then, seeing that Margaret looked even more
mystified than before, she added, by way of explanation:
“Years ago, Buddie and I made up a code.
We didn’t have any other children to play with and
so we read many books of thrilling adventure. In one
of them we found the inspiration for our code and
we used to write letters to each other, pretending to
tell secrets of a very serious nature. Honestly,
Megsy, I have spent hours trying to decipher some
message that Malcolm had sent me, to find, of
course, that it was all make believe. We each had
a key to the code, and evidently Malcolm still has
his, but I am not real sure where mine is, but I think
it is somewhere in this old desk. Of course I know
that the message he has sent today is of a serious
nature, and I simply must find the key to the code
and decipher it as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>While Virginia talked she opened one drawer in
the old desk after another, removed papers yellowing
with age and felt in the far corners, but the
key to the code was not found.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose can be in that message?”
Margaret queried.</p>

<p>“I believe it has something to do with his mining
enterprise,” Virg said, then continued: “The facts,
so far, are that this Irish prospector, Pat Mahoy,
found what he believed to be paying ore on Second
peak and said that if brother and I would grubstake
him, we three would be partners. Malcolm decided
to return with Mr. Mahoy and look at the property,
and as you know, he has been gone three days. Now
I conclude that my brother believes the mine to be
a great find and wishes to tell me so in a way that
no one else can read. Perhaps he wants me to do
something that may be very important and that
must be kept a secret, hence he has used the code
of our childhood.” Then, rising, she left the desk
as she said: “I have searched there thoroughly but
not a sign of the key did I find.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a secret drawer to the old desk?”
Margaret asked, hopefully. If there was one thing
more than another that Margaret liked, it was mystery,
and the idea of a secret drawer or a panel that
slid back, had always delighted her. Virginia laughingly
shook her head. “Nary a secret drawer,” she
declared.</p>

<p>Just then the chimes of the old clock tolled the
hour of 10.</p>

<p>“Dear me; here it is mid-morning and we are no
nearer deciphering this message than we were when
it arrived,” Virginia declared, dolefully.</p>

<p>“Hark! Somebody is coming,” Margaret exclaimed.
“Who do you suppose it can be?”</p>

<p>She opened the door as she spoke. The cow-boy
Slim stood on the porch, sombrero in hand. “Miss
Virginia,” he said in his shy manner, “did Malcolm
leave word what he wanted me to do when I returned
from the Junction?”</p>

<p>“No he didn’t, Slim,” Virginia said. “I think
you would better use your own judgment. You
know my brother always wishes you to do that when
he is not at home. Just now he is away, and I do
not know when he will return. Is everything all
right here at the ranch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Virginia, and if it’s what you think
Malcolm would be wishin’ me to do I’ll join Rusty
up the north way, and help him drive in the yearlings.
Dick Dartly told me as there’d be a stampede
up that way and that Rusty is havin’ a hard
time roundin’ up the scattered yearlings. He’d be
glad of my help if you think as it would be right
for me to go.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s all right, Slim. Goodbye and good
luck.” The two girls waved to the departing cow-boy
and then turned back into the big, cheerful living-room
as the clock chimed the quarter hour.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, how time flies!” Virginia declared.
Then she pressed both hands upon her forehead saying
that she was going to think and think until she
could recall where she had put the key to the code.</p>

<p>“And while you are thinking, I will make my
bed.” Margaret said as she skipped to the adjoining
room, into which the sun was flooding. She began
to hum a little tune, but, in the middle of it she
stopped suddenly, for she had heard a squeal of
delight.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked peering out of the door.</p>

<p>“Inspiration!” Virginia laughingly responded.
“Come along with me. I do believe I recall where
I put the key to the code when I supposed Buddie
and I were through with it forever. Are you a
climber?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What will I have to climb?” asked
the mystified Margaret. “I did climb a tree once
and a ladder also. Which do you wish me to ascend
now?”</p>

<p>Virginia was leading the way to the kitchen
which was deserted at that hour. There she opened
a door into a long, dark storeroom at one end of
which was a straight up and down ladder made by
the nailing of boards across uncovered uprights.
Margaret looked up and saw a trap door in the ceiling.
“Does that lead to your attic?” she inquired.
Virginia was half way up the ladder, and, looking
over her shoulder, she replied merrily. “Follow me
and you shall see.”</p>

<h2 title='THE MESSAGE DECIPHERED' id='chXX'>
CHAPTER XX—THE MESSAGE DECIPHERED.
</h2>

<p>It was indeed an old fashioned attic into which
the two girls emerged. It was high in the middle
and the sloping roof formed the sides.</p>

<p>“Where is your inspiration leading you?” Margaret
inquired as she bent to follow Virginia into
a dark cobwebby corner.</p>

<p>“It’s my old play trunk,” the western girl replied,
“where I put all of my old castaway toys as
I outgrew them, and so, what is more natural than
that I should also have placed there the key to the
code when I had outgrown it.” As she spoke Virginia
was dragging a small dust-covered trunk, over
near the window, which was the only opening
through which light was coming.</p>

<p>The cover was lifted, revealing all sorts of play-things,
dolls, books and mechanical toys.</p>

<p>“Oh, good!” Virginia exclaimed, joyfully. “Even
if we don’t find the key to the code in here, how glad
I am that I happened to remember this old trunk.
What pleasure it will give to the Mahoy children.
I will have someone carry it down and let them play
with these things to their hearts’ content.” As she
spoke she took from the trunk first one toy and then
another. She did this eagerly, for time was flying
and she well knew that she must find the code, but
she seemed doomed to disappointment, for everything
had been taken from the trunk and not a scrap
of paper had been revealed. “How provoking!” she
declared as she arose.</p>

<p>Margaret had picked up a queer old doll dressed
in the costume of an early pioneer, when, from the
folds of its print gingham dress, a yellow paper
fluttered to the floor. With a cry of joy, Virginia
pounced upon it. “Oh! Oh!” she exclaimed, “that
dear old doll, Patience Putney has been keeping it
for me all this time. Now we will begin to decipher
my brother’s message. Goodness, I do hope it isn’t
too late. Give me the doll, Megsy, I’ll take her
downstairs and enthrone her in a place of honor to
reward her for her faithful vigilance through all
these years.”</p>

<p>Down the ladder the girls scrambled and into the
living-room they hurried. Then on the desk the
message from Malcolm was spread and also the key
to the code.</p>

<p>Both heads bent over the latter as Virginia said
eagerly: “First of all look for a Q with two tails
and see what it means. Malcolm has written that
all alone at the top so I think we would better decipher
it first.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” Margaret said, pouncing her finger
on the character in question. “It means ‘Very important.
Great haste required.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Megsy,” moaned Virginia, and just then the
clock chimed twelve. “It is three hours since we
first received the message.</p>

<p>“Now look for a T with a cross on the bottom as
well as on the top.” Virginia began as they both
searched the key, then she added, “Here it is! I’m
beginning to recall now how I used the key in
earlier days. I believe I will take it by myself,
Megsy. I think that I will soon be able to decipher
the message.”</p>

<p>“All right and while you are doing it I will make
your bed. Perhaps if I leave you all alone, you will
make better headway,” the other girl said, suiting
her actions to the words.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed before Virginia sprang up
and hurried to her friend’s open door. Margaret
sat by the sun-flooded window sewing. She glanced
up eagerly. “What is it, Virg? You look troubled.”</p>

<p>Virginia sank on the bed truly the picture of despair.
“Oh, Megsy, what shall I do?” she said, “but
first I’ll read you the message. ‘Dear sister. I find
the ore to be of excellent quality; the best I do believe
that has been found in these parts for many
years. Pat Mahoy and I must go at once to Douglas
and record the location papers. Send one of the
cow-boys to stay in the hut on Second Peak until
we return. Tell him that he is to report to me if he
sees anyone lurking about the property.</p>

<p>“‘Hastily, <span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>.’”</p>

<p>Virginia looked up woefully. “If only I had
been able to read the message before I told Slim to
join Rusty in the north! That is fully two hours
ago and by this time he is far out of reach. However,
he might have gone by the way of the Dartly
Ranch, and, if he did, I am sure that Mrs. Dartly
would have insisted upon his remaining there for
the noon meal. I’ll call up and inquire.”</p>

<p>Skipping to the telephone in the living-room, Virginia
was soon talking with her nearest neighbor
four miles away. “Slim isn’t here now,” that good
woman replied. “He did stop some time ago and I
asked him to stay to lunch but he said he had some
business to talk over with old Mr. Dodd up at
Double Cross Ranch and that he would get some
frijoles there. If it’s very important Virginia, I
could send my boy over to the Dodds, but it would
be several hours before he could make the round
trip. It’s a pity now that they haven’t a ’phone.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, don’t send Jack. I’ll just have to
manage some way without Slim. Thank you, Mrs.
Dartly.”</p>

<p>Margaret was standing near, eagerly waiting for
Virginia to finish the telephone conversation.</p>

<p>The western girl rose with a determined expression
in her eyes as she said: “Megsy, there is only
one thing left to do, and I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” the eastern girl asked.</p>

<p>“It is that I must go myself and stay in the log
cabin on Second Peak until my brother returns from
recording the location papers in Douglas. He will
have started already, believing that I will at once
obey his instructions and send one of the cow-boys
to watch the property, and since it is as much to my
interest as his to have it protected, I must go.”</p>

<p>Margaret’s eyes were wide with amazement.
“Why, Virginia,” she exclaimed, “do you mean that
you, a mere girl, would go and stay alone all night
in an old log hut on that desolate mountain?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded. “Well, then, I’m going with
you.” Margaret’s tone sounded as determined as
her friend’s.</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t allow you to go, dear,” Virginia
protested. “You aren’t used to the loneliness of the
mountains as I am. I love it. Then night noises
do not frighten me in the least and there is very
seldom a wild animal prowling about that is not
more afraid of me than I am of it.”</p>

<p>“If you go, I’m going also,” Margaret repeated
with emphasis, then putting her arms about her
friend, she declared gaily: “It will be something exciting
about which to write to dear old Babs.” Then
she added with sweet seriousness. “I’d be heaps
more worried and unhappy all alone here on the
ranch, not knowing what might be happening to
you than I would be were I with you. If you are to
be eaten by a grizzly, then I wish to be devoured
also.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed as she began to don her khaki
riding habit. “What if the fierce outlaw that is
supposed to be hiding somewhere in the Seven Peak
Range should happen to visit the hut in the night?”
she asked merrily. Not that she had any faith in
the existence of the rumored outlaw, but she wished
to persuade Margaret to remain at home.</p>

<p>“Let him come if he wishes,” the eastern girl
said. “If you aren’t skeered of him, neither am I.”
This sounded very brave, but in her heart Margaret
was hoping that they would meet neither a bear nor
an outlaw.</p>

<h2 title='TWO COURAGEOUS GIRLS' id='chXXI'>
CHAPTER XXI—TWO COURAGEOUS GIRLS.
</h2>

<p>Half an hour later the two girls were in the
saddle, cantering toward the distant mountains.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it good to be alive on a day like this?” Margaret
exclaimed as she gazed over the wide desert
that was gleaming white in the early afternoon sun.
“Somehow, when everything is sparkling and seeming
to rejoice, I just can’t be skeered of a bear or
even an outlaw that may be lurking on Second
Peak.”</p>

<p>“I love the desert,” Virginia declared, “but then,
I have always lived here. I do believe that I will
feel smothered and as shut in as a bird in a cage
if you and I go east to boarding school next winter.”</p>

<p>The two girls were riding side by side. A mile
ahead of them the Seven Peak Range loomed
rugged and uninviting.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose that boarding school will seem
strange to you,” Margaret continued the conversation,
“and probably the chatter of so many girls will
make you dizzy just at first. It did me, for although
I had never lived in as silent a place as this, I had
been an only child, unused to the merriment of many
girls, but one soon becomes accustomed to it.” Then
suddenly she turned toward her friend with eyes
that glowed. “Oh, Virg,” she exclaimed, “before
we do go, I will write to Mrs. Martin, she’s the principal
and such a dear, and ask her if we may reserve
the big, sunny corner room that overlooks the orchard.
There are three single beds in it and so you
and Babs and I can be roommates.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed. “Megsy,” she said, “we are
letting our imaginations run riot. We are like the
old woman who counted her chickens before they
were hatched. Here we are spending the money
that we hope the mine will bring to us when, as yet,
the location papers have not been recorded.”</p>

<p>“But they will be, won’t they?” Margaret asked,
turning questioning eyes toward the speaker.
“Surely in a short 24 hours no one else will discover
the place when it has been there for centuries
undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“Stranger things have happened,” Virginia said,
“but here’s where we go single file, Megsy. The trail
is very steep in places. Don’t try to direct Star.
Let him climb as he wishes and he will carry you to
the old hut in safety.”</p>

<p>“How dark it is in the canyon,” Margaret said
as she looked ahead with a shudder. “No one would
dream that the sun is shining so brightly out on the
desert.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get used to the dimness in a minute and
then you will see many interesting things,” her
friend assured her. Megsy did not reply but she
sincerely hoped that the interesting things would not
be a bear nor the rumored outlaw.</p>

<p>Virginia had been right. As soon as their eyes
became accustomed to the dimness of the canyon
after the glaring sunlight on the desert, Margaret
did see many things that interested her. This was
not the trail they had ascended on the day of the
storm.</p>

<p>“It is a shorter way,” Virginia had said. “I am
so eager to reach the old hut at least an hour before
sunset that we may make ourselves comfortable before
the night settles down.”</p>

<p>The trail in some places seemed perilously steep
to the eastern girl and how glad she was that Virginia
was riding ahead, for, she did not wish her
friend to know how truly terrorized she was, and
there were times when she even closed her eyes tight
and clung to the pony. Luckily her trust was not
misplaced, for Star, being accustomed to mountain
trails ascended slowly and without stumbling until
the wider upper trail was reached. There, Margaret
once again breathed freely. Then to her surprise
Virginia swung around in her saddle and called
merrily, “Bravo, Megsy! You took that climb like
a true Westerner. Honestly I expected any moment
to hear you protest that you simply couldn’t
make it.”</p>

<p>Margaret was half tempted to explain that she
had closed her eyes tight that she might not see the
sheer descent below her, but she decided not to tell
at present. She was pleased with Virginia’s praise
and hoped that in time she would be courageous
enough to deserve it.</p>

<p>“Just another turn or two and then we will see
the hut among the pines,” Virg called over her
shoulder when suddenly Margaret whispered,
“Hark! Did you hear a noise?”</p>

<p>They drew rein and listened intently, but heard
and saw nothing. However, when they started on
again, a lithe, cat-like creature leaped from near
jutting rocks, darted ahead of them up the trail and
then disappeared.</p>

<p>Margaret was terrorized. She had seen Virginia
reach for her small gun, and then, as though seemingly
on second thought, replace it allowing the creature
to escape.</p>

<p>“What was it, Virg, and why didn’t you shoot
it?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“It was only a small lion,” the western girl replied,
“and it was more afraid of us than we were of it.”
Margaret doubted this statement, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Then Virginia added. “My brother Malcolm
does wish me to shoot them whenever I see them because
they prey upon our young calves, but I didn’t
this time because I do not wish anyone who might
be near to know of our presence.”</p>

<p>This was not very reassuring to the eastern girl,
for it suggested that Virginia believed that someone
might be lurking near whose closer acquaintance
they would not wish to make. This was truer than
either of the girls dreamed.</p>

<h2 title='NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS' id='chXXII'>
CHAPTER XXII—NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS.
</h2>

<p>The sun was nearing the western horizon when
at last the two girls swung from their ponies and
entered the log cabin which did indeed look deserted
and desolate standing alone so high on a
mountain surrounded only by stunted pines.</p>

<p>Margaret glanced around fearfully thinking that
the wild creature they had met might have selected
this cabin as a safe retreat, but the place was empty.</p>

<p>“Good,” Virginia exclaimed brightly. “Malcolm
has left us plenty to eat. Here is cold fried rabbit
enough for our supper and I certainly am hungry.
There are good beds for us, too. The pine boughs
are fresh under the blankets. You will be surprised
to find what comfortable beds Malcolm can make
with boughs. He knows just how to place them one
on another to make a mattress both soft and springy.
Megsy, suppose you get out the sandwiches that we
brought and spread them on this rustic table while I
feed the ponies, and too, I’ll bring some water from
a spring just above here.”</p>

<p>Margaret was on the verge of saying that she
hoped the spring wasn’t far away, as she dreaded
being left alone even for a moment, but instead she
said: “Very well, Virg, I’m hungry too, and we’ll
have a fine feast when you return.”</p>

<p>Margaret had begged Virginia to permit her to
come to the mountains and so the eastern girl determined
to appear brave if she succumbed in the
attempt. She wondered what Babs and the other
girls in boarding school would think if they could
see her at that moment, and the thought so amused
her that she almost laughed aloud, when suddenly,
something crashed behind her and with a cry of terror
she whirled about, sure that she would behold
the mountain lion crouched to spring upon her, but
instead she saw a small box lying on the floor beneath
the open window. Believing that it had been
blown from the ledge by a breeze that was rising,
Margaret, with a sigh of relief, went to pick it up
when she saw, fastened to it, a piece of yellow wrapping
paper on which a message was scrawled in a
language unknown to her. Again she was frightened.
What if the rumored outlaw had reached in
and had left that message as some sort of a warning
for the girls.</p>

<p>Tiptoeing to the open window she looked out.
Not a sound was to be heard nor a creature seen
and yet there was the message. Where had it come
from?</p>

<p>A moment later Virginia appeared with a pail of
water. “We’ll have to hurry, Megsy,” she said,
without looking at her friend, who stood in the
middle of the room, pale and trembling; “that is if
we are to eat our fine feast before the sun sets, and
I’d heaps rather eat it by daylight than by the one
lone lantern that Malcolm seems to have left for
us.”</p>

<p>While Virginia talked, Margaret was trying to regain
her courage and to the surprise she heard herself
saying quite calmly: “Virg, here is a message
of some sort.”</p>

<p>The western girl took it and exclaimed: “Oh!
Malcolm’s writing.” Then, after glancing it over,
she added in a matter-of-fact tone, “You see he
thought one of the cow-boys would be here tonight
and so he has written some directions in the Mexican
lingo which we all understand.”</p>

<p>Margaret was greatly relieved. “Is it anything
important?” she asked.</p>

<p>If Virginia hesitated before replying, it was for so
brief a second that the eastern girl did not notice it.
“Not so very,” she replied. “Malcolm expects to be
back early tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>Then together they sat on the rude bench by the
rustic table that leaned against the wall and if Virginia
seemed thoughtful, Margaret decided that it
was because her responsibility was really more than
a girl should assume. Had Margaret known the real
character of the message left by Malcolm, she would
have been unable to partake of the sandwiches and
fried rabbit with the zest that she did.</p>

<p>Virginia after a thoughtful few moments began
an assumed merry conversation and then, as soon as
the sun was set, she suggested that they retire early
that they need not light the lantern.</p>

<p>“Why?” Margaret asked, on the alert at once.
“Do you fear that some one might see it and find out
where we are?”</p>

<p>Virginia’s laugh sounded natural. “A light always
attracts bugs and beetles,” she exclaimed merrily,
“and we will sleep better if they stay away. I
do not want to close the one window, since it has
only a wooden blind and we will need the air.”</p>

<p>Margaret did not openly protest, but to herself
she thought: “I’ll never sleep a wink, I know, with
that window open, for how easy it would be for the
mountain lion to spring in and eat us up before we
knew it.”</p>

<p>But after a time, the fragrance of pine boughs
lulled the tired girl to sleep, and when Virginia was
sure that the slumber was not feigned, she rose very
quietly and tiptoed toward the door.</p>

<h2 title='NIGHT PROWLERS' id='chXXIII'>
CHAPTER XXIII—NIGHT PROWLERS.
</h2>

<p>Virginia, sincerely hoping that the eastern girl
would not awaken, tiptoed out of the log cabin and
very quietly closed the door. She was carrying the
unlighted lantern and some matches. Not far from
the cabin was a small cave. In this Virginia went
and struck a light when she was sure that it would
not be seen by anyone outside. Then opening the
brown paper, she read again and more carefully
what her brother, Malcolm, had written.</p>

<p>The property which he wished observed lay directly
below the cave far down in the canyon, but it was
not this part of the message which had stirred Virginia
to action. It was that which followed.</p>

<p>“Pat Mahoy states that about a week ago while
he was prospecting about here, a desert-rat sort of a
man took him by surprise. He has feared ever since
that the man may have suspected that the property
was valuable and that he might return, so don’t
sleep until we get back. Keep alert and on the
watch.”</p>

<p>Little did Malcolm dream when he wrote that hastily
scrawled message that it would be a mere girl
and his most dearly loved sister who would assume
the truly dangerous position of night watch.</p>

<p>Leaving the lantern in the cave, Virginia went
out into the darkness and stood leaning against a
boulder where she could not be seen but where she
could observe the downward slope of the canyon.</p>

<p>Every half hour she went to the cabin and listened
at the open window that she might be assured that
Margaret was still sleeping undisturbed.</p>

<p>It was on her return from one of these visits to
the cabin that she uttered an exclamation of dismay,
for, far down in the canyon, she saw lights moving
about.</p>

<p>What could it mean? At first she thought there
were but two, but then she counted three. Tensely
she watched. For a brief while the lights were
close together as though whoever carried them were
conferring on some plan of action. Then one of the
lights seemed to settle permanently in one spot and
two of them began to ascend the trail that led toward
the log cabin. Virginia leaped into the cave
and put out the light in her lantern. Then she
sprang back to her post of observation. It would be
some time before whoever was coming could reach
the top of the trail. What ought she to do? What
could she do?</p>

<p>Perhaps she ought to warn Margaret at once and
yet the eastern girl would be so terrorized that it
would but add to the problem confronting Virginia.
Moreover, if it should be Malcolm returning, she
would have frightened Margaret without reason,
and so she determined to wait until she herself might
be assured of the identity of the bearers of the light
who seemed to be slowly ascending the trail.</p>

<p>At last they were near enough for Virginia, who
was listening intently to hear their voices, and to her
dismay, she realized that she had never heard them
before. Then as the light of the lanterns was
thrown upon them, although she could not see their
faces, she knew from the build of each that to her
they were strangers. One was of slight, graceful
build and the other heavy set. They seemed to be
having a heated discussion and Virginia clearly
heard the younger man say: “If it’s crooked work
you are up to, I’ll not go a step further.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do as I say,” was the surly reply.</p>

<p>Terrorized, when again the lanterns began to ascend
the trail, Virginia sped to the cabin and
awakened Margaret.</p>

<p>“What is it, Virginia?” Margaret asked, half
awake, as she rose. “Is it a bear or the outlaw?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush!” Virginia whispered. “Be quiet
as you can and follow me. There are two strange
men coming up the trail. They do not mean to
harm us, of course, for they do not know of our
existence, but they probably plan visiting this hut,
and we don’t want them to find us here. Climb
through the window and then we will crouch down
in the dark until we can slip away.”</p>

<p>Although Margaret was terrorized, the courage of
her Puritan ancestors must have asserted itself, for
she did just as Virginia bade her. Silently the
girls crept through the small open window and hurried
to a place of hiding in a clump of dwarf pines,
and none too soon, for a moment later lights appeared
in the cabin.</p>

<p>They were near enough to hear an exclamation
of surprise, followed by a surly voice. “Huh! Folks
been here seems like, and mighty recent. Two hats
yonder belonin’ to gals, I take it. Tom, get a move
on ye and find who ’twas just left here. Like as
not whoever ’tis has the information we’re wishin’
to obtain.”</p>

<p>Evidently the one addressed as Tom didn’t move.
“Stubborn again?” the voice inquired. “Then it’s
myself as will hunt for whoever escaped.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, the frightened girls crouched lower,
hoping that they would escape observation, but unfortunately,
the grey of the dawn had come and
Margaret’s red belt and neck handkerchief gleamed
among the green pines and attracted the roving eye
of the searcher.</p>

<p>“Wall,” he remarked, “sort of playin’ hide and
seek with me, was ye? Come out now, and if ye’ll
tell all ye know about what’s goin’ on around here
you won’t be hurt, not one scratch.”</p>

<p>Virginia, holding Margaret’s hand in a firm clasp,
arose, for she knew there was no other alternative.
The heavy-set man was a type of which she had
heard but had never before seen. She knew that
he could be merciless and so with a pretence of
bravery which with difficulty she assumed, Virginia
led Margaret toward the cabin.</p>

<p>She glanced at the slight young man who stood
watching them and she was sure that she saw in his
bronzed face an expression of pity. Then in another
moment, something very unexpected had happened.</p>

<p>The surly man, intent upon obtaining whatever
information he could from the two girls, had forgotten
for the moment that the lad, whom he had
addressed as Tom, was not in sympathy with his
plans. Had he chanced to glance at the youth he
would have seen an expression in his eyes that would
have warned him that he would better not bully the
girls too much. But, for the moment the older man
had entirely forgotten his companion.</p>

<p>When they neared the cabin, he commanded,
“Turn around here, gals! Tell me all ye know
about this here mining property and tell it quick.”</p>

<p>Virginia was defiantly silent, but Margaret, whose
courage was gone, began to sob, and it was at that
moment that the lad called Tom confronted the bully
and in each hand he held a gun.</p>

<p>“Coward!” he said, “I’ll not stand by and see
you frighten two mere girls. Down the trail with
you and don’t so much as look back or I’ll fire.”</p>

<p>The man obeyed sullenly, and Tom stood leaning
against the boulder to be sure that his orders were
carried out. Then, turning to the girls, he said,
“Young ladies, do you wish me to remain here until
you are better protected or do you prefer to be
alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, please stay!” Virginia implored, for,
brave as she had been, she was after all only a girl,
and she had been thoroughly frightened. “My
brother Malcolm, and Pat Mahoy may return at any
moment now and so I am sure that you will not be
long delayed.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter how long I am delayed,” the
youth said, and in his voice there was a tone of
hopelessness which Virginia noted with sudden sympathy.
“I’ll stand here and watch the trail for a
time,” he added.</p>

<p>“And I will prepare breakfast,” the western girl
said brightly; “then you come when it is ready.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Virginia called and the lad left
his post feeling sure that they were not to be
molested. When he had washed at the spring he
entered the hut and sat with the girls at the rustic
table. Virginia liked the lad and was indeed puzzled
to know why he had been in such bad company.</p>

<p>“You girls were brave to come up here alone,”
Tom said, “Weren’t you afraid?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I was,” Margaret confided, “because, you
see, we had heard that an outlaw is hiding somewhere
on Second Peak. Do you suppose that it is
true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the lad replied, “it is true. I am the outlaw.”</p>

<h2 title='A “TAME” OUTLAW' id='chXXIV'>
CHAPTER XXIV—A “TAME” OUTLAW.
</h2>

<p>When the lad called Tom calmly remarked, “I
am that outlaw,” Margaret, who had supposed an
outlaw to be a villain, such as she had seen in the
moving pictures, did not know how to reply, but
Virginia, used to the ways of the West, held out her
hand to the lad and said with sweet sincerity, “Tom,
I believe that you are either innocent, or that you
hastily committed some act which you now deeply
regret.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your confidence,” the lad replied.</p>

<p>The eastern girl found it hard to convince herself
that she was awake. Could it be that she,
brought up in the most conservative manner, was
really breakfasting in a log hut on a mountain peak
with an outlaw? She glanced furtively at the lad
and, noting a kindly expression in his face, she decided
that he must be a tame outlaw and one of
whom she need not be afraid.</p>

<p>What an exciting letter she would be able to write
to Babs, and how that girl, who had always thirsted
for adventure, would envy her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom leaped to his feet and listened intently.
Virginia followed him as he went with long
strides toward the open door.</p>

<p>“Two men are coming up the trail,” he reported,
“but they are not the ones we so recently dismissed.”</p>

<p>Virginia sprang forward with a cry of joy. “Oh,
it is brother Malcolm,” she exclaimed. When the
young man in the lead had dismounted, he stared
in uncomprehending amazement at the two girls and
the strange lad.</p>

<p>“Virginia! Margaret! What does this mean?”
he asked. He sensed at once that something very
unusual had happened.</p>

<p>“Rusty and Slim were away,” Virginia explained,
“and so we girls had to come, and oh, brother,
brother, we have been so frightened, but this brave
lad has been our protector.”</p>

<p>When the whole story had been told, Malcolm
held out his hand. “You say that you are an outlaw.
As you know it is the custom of the desert to
ask no questions, but, Tom, you are not an outlaw
from our home. From this day on, for as long as
you wish to remain, I engage your services. Will
you accept?”</p>

<p>“I do and thank you. I sincerely hope that you
will find me worthy of the trust.”</p>

<p>“I know we will,” Malcolm declared heartily,
“and, to complete your name cow-boy fashion we
will call you Trusty Tom.”</p>

<p>An hour after the return of Malcolm and Pat
Mahoy, Virginia approached her brother, saying, “Do
you think it would be safe now for Margaret and
me to return to the ranch? We are both very weary
and believe that we could rest better at home.”</p>

<p>Malcolm glanced up from the rustic table where
he had been so busily figuring that the time had
passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I had planned returning with you,” he said
thoughtfully, “but I would rather remain here a
few hours longer. Where is Trusty Tom? I will
ask him to accompany you home.”</p>

<p>“He is with Pat Mahoy,” Virginia began, when
Margaret, from the doorway said, “Here he is
now.” Then she called to the approaching lad,
“Tom, Malcolm wishes to speak to you.” The boy
at the table looked up with a welcoming smile. “If
you believe that it would be safe for the girls to return
home, Tom, I wish you would accompany
them,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I will gladly,” the other lad replied, “and
if need be, I will protect them with my life.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the three horses left the canyon
trail and started across the gleaming desert.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to get away from the mountains,” Margaret
declared, “for out here on the open desert, we
can see whoever is coming and not be surprised by
friend or foe.”</p>

<p>“Except in one place,” Virginia added, “and that
is where the trail crosses the creek bottom. The
banks are so high, a whole regiment could be hiding
down there and we wouldn’t know it until we were
quite upon them, but I’m not anticipating trouble,
are you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No,” the lad replied, “not for you girls,” he
added. “Surely no one on the desert would wish
to harm you.”</p>

<p>Virginia glanced up quickly and wondered if he
were fearful that someone might be watching for
him. How she did wish that she could ask him to
tell her all about it, but she knew that on the desert
no one asked a stranger his name or destination.</p>

<p>An hour later, as they were approaching the spot
where the trail descended into the rocky creek bottom,
Tom, who was in the lead, whirled in his saddle
and lifted a warning hand.</p>

<p>“Stay here,” he said softly, “while I ride ahead
that I may be sure that it is safe for you to descend
the creek trail.”</p>

<p>The girls did as he bade them, and while the lad
rode forward, Margaret asked fearfully: “What
aroused Tom’s suspicions, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he just wishes to be cautious,” Virginia
replied, but had Margaret been able to see her
friend’s face at that moment, she would have known
that her words were not expressing her true thought,
for the western girl had also seen the something
that had alarmed the lad and that something was a
face peering above the bank close to the mesquite
bush. It, however, had quickly disappeared when
Tom started alone toward the creek trail.</p>

<p>Virginia delayed but one moment, and then touching
Comrade with her quirt, she was soon riding at
the boy’s side.</p>

<p>“Tom,” she said in a low voice, “I also saw that
face. Do you think it is the man with whom you
were last night? Is he lying in wait for us?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” Trusty Tom declared. “I believe
whoever is in hiding is there for some other reason.”</p>

<p>Margaret, not wishing to be left behind, had
urged Star to a gallop and rode close to Virginia.
In another moment they would be able to see down
the slope of the creek trail, but, before they were
near enough to begin the descent horsemen appeared,
coming up, and with a cry of relief, Virginia
urged Comrade ahead of the others as she exclaimed
to the man in the lead, “Oh, Mr. Rizor, it is
only you, isn’t it? We girls have such active imaginations
today.” Then, turning to Margaret, she
added, “Megsy, this is the sheriff from Douglas.
Mr. Rizor, these are my friends, Margaret Selover
and Tom, who are from the East.”</p>

<p>Virginia had been thinking fast from the moment
she first saw the sheriff, and yet, from the self-possessed
way in which she talked none could have
surmised that she was truly concerned. Her first
thought had been, “Tom is a self-confessed outlaw.
If the sheriff and his men are looking for him I
must try to protect him as he protected us.”</p>

<p>“My wife told me you had a girl friend stayin’
with you from the East, Miss Virginia,” Mr. Rizor
was saying, “but she didn’t mention a boy.”</p>

<p>As the sheriff spoke, he gazed keenly at the lad
whose expression, Virginia was glad to note, did not
express guilt.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for someone who has been
breaking the law, Mr. Rizor?” the western girl
asked, anxious to attract those penetrating grey eyes
from Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s who we’re after,” the sheriff replied.
“Two nights ago, the Number Six Limited was held
up in Rattlesnake Canyon and the mail car was
robbed. The track walker reported that he had seen
two men and a lad of about eighteen, lurking around
there an hour before the limited was due, and he
thinks he could recognize any one of them if he
could see them again.”</p>

<p>At that moment one of the men uttered an exclamation
and pointed toward the south, where, faint
and far through powerful glasses he saw two horsemen
making for the Mexican border.</p>

<p>The sheriff took the glasses and looked through
them intently for a long moment.</p>

<p>“See you again,” he called over his shoulder, as,
with his men, he started in quick pursuit, and Virginia
with a sinking heart, noticed that the steel
grey eyes looked directly at Tom as though the
words were meant especially for him.</p>

<p>When the sheriff and his men were gone, the three
young people rode silently down the dry creek trail
and up on the other side.</p>

<p>Tom was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“It was mighty good of you, Miss Virginia, to
protect me the way you did,” he said, earnestly. “I
am afraid however, that you believe me to be one of
the three who held up the mail train, but indeed, it
is not so. I was in Rattlesnake Canyon when the
two men came along. I didn’t have a bite to eat
and they shared with me. I told them that I was
planning to walk the tracks until I reached Douglas,
and that there I meant to obtain work if I could.
The man, with whom you saw me later, assured
me that he could give me remunerative employment
if I would wait for them over at Second Peak. I
did not at the time inquire the nature of the employment
nor, did I know, until I heard the sheriff telling
about it, that they had robbed the mail train. The
next day I met the two men at the spot upon which
we had agreed, and they told me what they wished
me to do. I refused, saying that I did not care to
do crooked work. I hope that you will believe me,
for what I have told you is the truth.”</p>

<p>“I do indeed believe you,” Virginia exclaimed,
“and if need be, we will tell your story to Mr. Rizor.
Good! Here is dear old V. M. I’m glad to be
home, aren’t you, Megsy? I feel as though we had
been away a year. Tom, there is the bunkhouse
yonder, I think Slim and Rusty Pete must be there
for their ponies are in the corral. Tell them that
you are our new cow-boy. They’ll like you and I’m
sure that you will like them.”</p>

<p>When the girls had dismounted at the wide front
veranda, and Tom had led their ponies back to the
corral, they entered the house and Margaret sank
down in a big, comfortable chair as she said with a
sigh of contentment. “Well, now I am beginning
to feel real once more. Honestly, Virg, I haven’t
been a bit sure but that I might wake up and find
either that I was a character in a Zane Grey story
or that it was a dream and a nightmare at that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Here’s the mail pouch!” Virginia exclaimed
gleefully. “Someone has been to town.”</p>

<p>“I do hope that there is a letter from Babs,” Margaret
said.</p>

<p>“I am so eager to know if she has learned more,
as yet, about her lost brother, Peyton.”</p>

<h2 title='THE SHERIFF’S VISIT' id='chXXV'>
CHAPTER XXV—THE SHERIFF’S VISIT.
</h2>

<p>A letter from Babs was the first one that
tumbled out on the big library table when Virginia
held the pouch upside down. Other papers and letters
rattled out, but both girls were eager to hear
the news from Margaret’s former room-mate in the
far-away boarding school.</p>


<p class='ni mt10'>“Dearest Megsy and Virg,” Margaret read
aloud.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy today that I could sing like a lark,
but since it is silence period, I would better just pen
my joy to you two dear girls, who will, I know, rejoice
with me. I am just absolutely convinced now
that I know where my dear brother Peyton is. Of
course his messages to me continue to be mysterious;
that is, he doesn’t sign his full name, only his initials.
I’m sure that they must be his, for I do not know
anyone else in the world whose name begins with
P. and W.</p>

<p>“It is just as I supposed in the very beginning.
He did run away to sea, for I have now received five
picture postcards signed P. W., and they were
mailed at different ports in China, Japan and the
East Indies. I know he is sending them to me because
he realizes how unhappy I would be if I had
no knowledge of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>“I do wish that I could write to him and tell him
how happy I am just to be assured that he is well
and alive, but since he wishes to be so mysterious, I
will have to be content.</p>

<p>“And now I will tell you something else. I am
saving every penny of my allowance, and before I
start for the West I am going to buy a whole khaki
outfit like the girls wear in the moving pictures. Oh,
Megsy, how you would have laughed the other day
if you could have seen our French riding master’s
expression when I asked him if he would try to get
a horse that bucks, upon which I might practice riding.</p>

<p>“‘Mees Wente,’ he said, ‘how is it that you mean?
A horse that bucks? In Paris we do not have heem.’</p>

<p>“Every girl in the riding class wanted to shout,
but of course, you know Professor La Fleur is so
prim and proper we couldn’t even smile.</p>

<p>“However, as soon as we came back from the
canter, we all met in my room and made fudge and
we laughed so loud and so long that Miss Pickle put
her head in at the door and asked if we thought it
was quite ladylike to laugh in so boisterous a manner.</p>

<p>“Girls, when I get out on the desert, I am going
way up om the trail Virginia calls her Inspiration
Peak, and I’m going to shout just as loud and long
as ever I wish. I’m so tired of always having to be
proper and ladylike.</p>

<p>“Good-bye for now.</p>

<div class='sc tar mt05' style='margin-right:4em'>“Your pal,</div>
<div class='sc tar' style='margin-right:2em'>“Babs.</div>
<p class='mb10'>“P. S.—Megsy, aren’t you glad that I have located
my dear brother, Peyton?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;B. B. W.”</p>

<p>Before Margaret could comment about the letter,
there came a sharp rap on the front door, and Virginia,
springing to open it, wondered who might
be there.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Rizor but his men were not with him.
Luckily Virginia had expected that the sheriff would
stop at V. M. on his way back to town and so she
did not express surprise, although Margaret did.
Luckily Mr. Rizor did not glance at the eastern girl,
who wisely busied herself in another part of the
room. “Miss Virginia,” he said, “may I come in?
There’s a matter I wish to be speakin’ about.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course you may come in Mr. Rizor,”
the girl said, opening the door welcomingly wide,
“and I hope that you will remain with us for the
midday meal which is about to be served.”</p>

<p>Evidently he had not accompanied his men to the
Mexican border, and Virginia was wondering about
his reason for not having done so.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’ll not be stopping but a minute,” he
said. “My men are following what they think is a
pretty sure trail, but my presence is more needed
back in town today and so I’m headin’ that way,
but, bein’ as I had something very important to say
to you, I thought I’d stop even though it is a mile
farther.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart beat rapidly. Had the sheriff
real knowledge about Tom, and had he come to arrest
him? If so, she must try to save their new
cow-boy, but, how could she do it? The girl had
been so busy with her own anxious thoughts that
she had failed to note the expression of pleased pride
that appeared in the face of the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Well, to come to the point, Miss Virginia,” he
was saying, “we’ve got company down to our house,
so to speak. Little Virginia Rizor arrived yesterday
and she weighs eight pounds. My wife told me
whether I caught the mail thief or not, I was to be
sure and stop and tell you that she wants you to
come as soon as you can to see your little namesake.”
Then he added, “we’re hoping that she’ll grow up to
be as fine a girl as you are.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s relief was so great that she almost
shouted for joy. “I am indeed glad, Mr. Rizor!”
she said. “Margaret, did you hear that splendid
news? Please tell Mrs. Rizor that my friend and I
will ride into town in a very few days to see her
and the darling little baby.”</p>

<p>When the sheriff was gone Virginia almost cried,
her relief was so great.</p>

<p>“The queer part of it is,” she told Margaret, “I
just know that Mr. Rizor believes our Tom was the
lad who was with the men who robbed the mail
train, but for my sake he isn’t going to say a word
about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” the other girl replied as she
pointed out of the window. Virginia looked and
saw that the sheriff, instead of taking the trail
toward town, was slowly and thoughtfully riding
toward the bunkhouse.</p>

<h2 title='WIELDING A CAN OPENER' id='chXXVI'>
CHAPTER XXVI—WIELDING A CAN OPENER.
</h2>

<p>When Margaret pointed out of the window, Virginia
sprang up and looked down toward the bunkhouse.
Was it possible that the sheriff did suspect
that Tom was one of the three who were supposed
to have held up the train in Rattlesnake canyon and
was he about to arrest the lad? If so Virginia determined
that she would try to save the young outlaw
even as he had saved the girls the night before
on lonely Second Peak.</p>

<p>She stood gazing intently out of the window ready
to run to the bunkhouse if she felt that her presence
were needed, but instead, when the sheriff drew rein,
and hailed, it was the cow-boy Rusty Pete who appeared
in the doorway. Slim quickly joined him,
and, from their smiling faces and the hearty way in
which they shook hands with Mr. Rizor, Virginia
realized that after all the sheriff’s mission had been
a peaceful one.</p>

<p>“He is a proud and happy father,” she said as
she turned from the window, “and he wants all of
his friends to rejoice with him, and so, after all,
Tom is safe here, at least for the present.”</p>

<p>Then, glancing at the clock, she exclaimed. “It is
nearly noon, and brother said that he would surely
reach V. M. at that hour and I just know that he
will be as hungry as a wolf.”</p>

<p>Virginia went to her room and Margaret to the
one adjoining and they visited through the door
that opened between while they changed from their
khaki riding habits to fresh pink and blue gingham
house dresses. Then arm in arm, they marched to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“You set the table, Megsy,” Virg directed, “while
I produce the viands. That is easily done on the
desert where we have to depend upon canned
foods.”</p>

<p>As she talked, she climbed up on a low step-ladder
in the adjoining pantry and selected several cans.
“Can you open them, Megsy, while I go to the cooling
cellar, and skim some nice thick cream for us?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>Margaret looked doubtfully at the can opener
which Virg was handing to her, but she replied confidently
enough. “Oh, I am sure that I can. I have
often seen our Dinah wield that weapon.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough,” Virg told her. “See, I’ll do
this one to show you how.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do that, I am sure I can,” Megsy declared,
and so Virg taking the skimmer and a big
bowl, went out the back door and descended to the
cool walled-in cellar where the milk was kept.</p>

<p>Megsy found that opening a can was not as easy
as it looked. “May I help?” a pleasant voice asked
and there in the open door stood the good-looking
young outlaw, sombrero in hand.</p>

<p>Virginia, who had at that moment appeared with
the cream, noted that, with his hat off, Tom’s face
looked refined, even aristocratic, and she was more
puzzled than ever concerning the identity of their
new cow-boy guest.</p>

<p>“Oh Tom,” Margaret looked up, her face flushed
from the unusual exertion. “Some good fairy must
have told you that we are in dire need of a strong
arm. Do you know how to wield this weapon, commonly
called a can opener?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do,” was the quick reply. “I have often
camped in the hills at home and so I am quite an
expert at the culinary art.”</p>

<p>Virginia made a mental note. Wherever Tom
came from there also were hills. Hanging his sombrero
on a rack near the door, Tom took the weapon
and dexterously opened one can after another.</p>

<p>“This surely is a varied menu,” he laughingly exclaimed
when the task was done. “How many cans
have you allowed for each boarder?”</p>

<p>Malcolm came in before Virg could reply, and
after having washed at the pump on the back porch
and rubbed his head well with the big rough towel
that was daily renewed, he took from his pocket a
comb and looking into the small mirror, he made
himself presentable.</p>

<p>He then went to his room for a moment’s rest and
when he was gone, Virg inquired. “By the way,
Tom, how did you like our cow-boys?”</p>

<p>“First rate. They are fine lads,” Tom said with
enthusiasm, “but their lingo is so different from that
which I am used to that at times I can hardly grasp
their meaning.”</p>

<p>“Point two,” thought Virginia. “Tom hasn’t
been in the cattle country long else he would be
familiar with the cow-boys’ manner of speaking.”</p>

<p>Oh, if one might ask questions—but the courtesy
of the desert forbade it.</p>

<p>Tom proved a very valuable aid and in a short
time Margaret was out on the back porch pulling the
rope which rang a bell and called the other two cow-boys
in for the noon repast.</p>

<p>One amusing thing happened which did not escape
the watchful Virginia. Tom, eager to assume his
new role of cow-boy, began eating in the manner
approved in the best society, but, noting that Slim
and Rusty Pete ate with their knives, a twinkle
appeared in his blue eyes while he did likewise. He
handled his knife, however, in a way which showed
plainly that he was unused to wielding it in a manner
so uncouth.</p>

<p>Virginia turned away to hide a smile. Of one
thing she was convinced. This outlaw had a sense
of humor.</p>

<p>Half an hour later when the dishes were washed
and cleared away and the girls retired to their rooms
for an afternoon siesta, Virginia confided, “Megsy, I
have never before been so interested in a boy as I
am in Tom, have you? Do you suppose we will
ever find out who he really is?”</p>

<h2 title='THE NEW COW-BOY' id='chXXVII'>
CHAPTER XXVII—THE NEW COW-BOY.
</h2>

<p>When the girls awakened from their siesta, arm
in arm they sauntered down to the corral where
they saw Tenderfoot Tom trying to ride a broncho,
but without much success. He leaped to the ground
when he beheld the girls and removing his hat, in a
manner unknown to cow-boys, he held it while he
talked. “Young ladies,” he said, “do I look important?
Slim and Rusty Pete have gone with your
brother to some distant part of the range and may
be away until the morrow and I, if you please, am
the cow-boy in charge of V. M. Ranch and no longer
merely a—.”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence and Virg wondered
if he had planned saying outlaw, but Margaret was
finishing it for him by merrily adding, “can opener.”</p>

<p>“Let me prove that I really am a cook,” the lad
exclaimed brightly. “Suppose you two damsels go
for a canter and do not return until six o’clock, and
then you shall see what you shall see.”</p>

<p>Catching and saddling Star and Comrade took
but a few moments and then the lad stood waving
his sombrero to the girls as they rode away. Ten
minutes later when they had reached the top of the
mesa trail, Margaret looked back. Her exclamation
of surprise caused Virginia also to turn. They saw
Tom with his gun over his shoulder riding away in
the opposite direction. “What can that mean?”
Margaret wondered. “Do you suppose that he
wishes to be rid of us that he might leave the V. M.
Ranch?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he wants to go, let him,” Virginia replied.
“We will ride over to the junction and
ask Mrs. Wells if she knows someone who would
like to cook for us. That is the part of our home
work that Uncle Tex assumes when he is here. I
never knew that dear old man to stay away from
V. M. for two whole months before, and now it is
nearly three. He often goes for six weeks or so. I
believe that he likes to roam but he gets homesick
after a time and comes back for a good long stay.”</p>

<p>“Poor old man,” Margaret said. “Perhaps he
plans staying away until he thinks I am gone. The
mere idea of being my guardian evidently frightened
him.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled but her thought had reverted to
Tom. “I can’t believe that our new cow-boy is really
deserting us, and yet it did seem strange for him
to ride away as soon as we were gone. However,
we will find out when we return. Here is where we
dip down into the dry creek bottom. At this time of
the year it is perfectly safe to ride along there. It’s
a short-cut to the Junction but woe to man or beast
who takes it in the spring for a sudden cloud burst
in the mountains changes this creek into a raging
torrent before the trail leading out of it could possibly
be reached.”</p>

<p>Margaret looked anxiously at the sky that was
gleaming blue above the mountains, but not a sign of
a cloud was to be seen.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, they reached the trail that led
them again to the desert on the other side and there,
near the Santa Fe tracks, stood a combination station,
general store and dwelling. In it lived Mr.
and Mrs. Wells and their small son, Danny.</p>

<p>When at their rap Mrs. Wells opened the door,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Virginia Davis, what is your brother thinking
of to permit you to ride around alone these days?
Doesn’t he know there’s an outlaw supposed to be
hiding near here in the mountains? Folks say he is
fierce looking, like a story book pirate. There’s a
posse over from Texas hunting for him and a reward
offered for his capture dead or alive. He’ll
be caught soon, of course, but till he is, seems like
you girls ought to stay pretty close to home.”</p>

<p>Luckily at that moment Mrs. Wells was called into
the store, which opened from her living-room, and
so she did not see the look of concern and amazement
in the faces of her guests. “But that outlaw
can’t be our Tom,” Margaret protested. “He isn’t
fierce looking. He—” she said no more for their
hostess was returning.</p>

<p>She shook her head when Virginia inquired if
she could recommend someone who could cook for
them. “Miss Headsley’s gal might have liked the
place only she’s tuck another. She and Rattlesnake
Jim got jined last week and they’re homesteadin’ a
place now up her pa’s way.”</p>

<p>The girls refused a kindly given invitation to remain
to supper and they were soon in the saddle
cantering at top-speed toward V. M. Ranch. Virginia
felt very anxious, she hardly knew why. If
this posse was really searching for Tom, she ought
to be glad if he had escaped, but it didn’t seem
a bit like to him to go without even saying goodbye.
She just couldn’t believe that he had done so, but,
when they reached V. M., and no one came to take
their horses, with heavy hearts they walked up to
the house from the corral.</p>

<p>Virg in the lead, opened the front door and then
stood staring in amazement at what she saw within.</p>

<h2 title='A JOLLY SURPRISE' id='chXXVIII'>
CHAPTER XXVIII—A JOLLY SURPRISE.
</h2>

<p>“Tom!” Virginia’s manner of uttering the name
seemed almost like a cry of joy and the lad who was
wearing a white apron chef-fashion, turned toward
the open door with a pleasant smile of greeting. If
he noted the surprised expression on the faces of the
two girls, he did not attribute it to its real cause.
He supposed that they naturally were surprised to
behold the fine supper that was spread on the living-room
table which had been drawn close to the grate
where a cheerful log was burning.</p>

<p>“Oho! What a feast!” Margaret exclaimed hurriedly,
to cover their all too evident amazement at
finding the outlaw calmly preparing a meal when a
posse from Texas was supposed to be searching for
him. “Where did you get the young rabbits that
you have fried such a crispy brown?”</p>

<p>“I took my gun as soon as you were gone,” the
lad told them, “and went a-hunting, and, as you
well know, Miss Virginia, it takes only a short time
in the sage to bag as many young rabbits as one
may desire. Tomorrow, if we are still cooks of the
V. M. Ranch, I will vary the menu by bringing in
quail.”</p>

<p>While they were eating Tom asked: “What news
did you hear while you were away, or perhaps you
didn’t see anyone who had news to tell.” He was
looking at Virginia and his eyes seemed to hold
an eager inquiry. What should she say? Ought
she to tell him the truth and give him an opportunity
to ride to the north where the mountains were wild,
rugged and desolate and where he could hide with
greater safety?</p>

<p>“Yes, we did hear news,” Virginia replied. “At
the Junction we heard that a posse from Texas
is searching for someone who is supposed to be hiding
about here.”</p>

<p>Then impulsively she leaned toward the lad and
placed a hand on his arm as she said pleadingly, “if
you were my brother I would suggest that you ride
to the north where the mountains are nearly impenetrable
and stay there in hiding until this search
is over. I do wish that you would go, Tom, this
very night.”</p>

<p>The lad shook his head. “I can’t go—not tonight,
Miss Virginia,” he said. “You two girls are
all alone on V. M. Ranch and your brother trusts
me to look after you. I will stay right where I am
until your brother returns or until—well—until I
am found.”</p>

<p>When the repast had been cleared away the three
young people sat about the fireplace watching the
burning log. They talked little. The eastern girl
felt strangely uneasy and every little while she would
glance at one of the uncurtained windows as though
she expected to see a face peering in at them.</p>

<p>At last the clock chimed the hour of nine and
Tom arose. “Miss Virginia, Miss Margaret,” he
said as he held out a hand to each, “I want to thank
you for having been so kind and sisterly to me. Do
not be concerned about me. I promise to ride north
as soon as you are well protected. Goodnight.”</p>

<p>The two girls lay awake for hours waiting for,
they knew not what. It was nearly midnight before
they slept. Half an hour later Margaret sat up suddenly
and listened intently. Had she heard something,
she wondered, and if so, what?</p>

<p>Again she heard the noise which she believed must
have awakened her. Someone was trying to enter
the house, of that she was sure. Springing up and
throwing her bathrobe about her she ran into Virginia’s
room and shook her friend.</p>

<p>“What is it?” that girl asked, on the alert at
once.</p>

<p>“Hark!” whispered Margaret. “Can’t you hear
someone at the kitchen door?”</p>

<p>The western girl listened, “I surely do,” she replied,
“but my dear Megsy, it must be someone who
feels he has a right to come in, for he is not trying
to be quiet and he is using a key.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that it is your brother, Malcolm,
returning?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Virginia replied as she arose and slipped
on her robe. “Whoever it is has opened the door
and has entered the kitchen. I’ll light a candle and
investigate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Virg! Please, please don’t go out there
alone! Can’t we call Tom or someone?”</p>

<p>But it was too late for the girls could hear that
whoever had entered the house was approaching
Virginia’s bedroom. Margaret clung to her friend.
Even Virginia was puzzled, but the thing that gave
her confidence was the fact that the intruder was
not trying to be quiet. A moment later there came
a tap on the door.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” the girl asked, and, with a sigh of
relief, she recognized the voice that replied, “Miss
Virginia, dearie. Don’t be skeered. It’s jest me a
comin’ home after all these weeks away. It’s yo’
old Uncle Tex, Miss Virginia, dearie.”</p>

<p>With a cry of delight, the door was flung open and
the girl embraced the kind old man who had trotted
her on his knee when she was a baby and had
granted her every whim, if he could, since she was
grown.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Tex, where have you been ever since
you ran away just because you didn’t want to take
part in the ‘play-actin’?” the girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>The old man told that he had been way up north
on a sheep ranch. “But ah got wistful feelin’s to
see my little gal,” he said, “and so ah’s come back
home. They’re needin’ help up thar and they didn’t
want me to leave but ah tol’ them as how ah would
send a younger man to take my place if ah could
find one.” Then Uncle Tex scratched his head in a
puzzled manner, for he had suddenly thought of
something. “Miss Virginia, dearie,” he said, “thar’s
a parcel of men camped in the dry creek bottom a
mile below here. They stopped me, but they let me
go quick. They’re lookin’ for an outlaw from
Texas, and course they knew as ah wasn’t him.
Said they’d be up here in the mornin’ and ask yo’
fo’ breakfast. Wall, good night, Miss Virginia,
dearie. Ah’s sure glad to be home.”</p>

<p>When the old man was gone, Virginia began to
dress hurriedly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Margaret inquired.
“Warn Tom!” was her reply. “Uncle Tex is here
to protect us now and Tom must start for the north
without an hour’s delay.”</p>

<h2 title='TOM’S SPEEDY DEPARTURE' id='chXXIX'>
CHAPTER XXIX—TOM’S SPEEDY DEPARTURE.
</h2>

<p>“I wish you would dress, Megsy,” Virginia said.
“I would like you to accompany me.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Virginia opened the door very
quietly that she might not attract the attention of
the old cow-man and together the two girls stepped
out into the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>“What a cold black night it is,” Margaret said
as she drew more closely about her the woollen
scarf that she had thrown over her shoulders.
“Hark, what is that moaning sound?”</p>

<p>“It’s the wind rising. I believe we are going to
have a sand storm. Let’s creep low that we may
keep hidden among the mesquite bushes. The house
may be watched.”</p>

<p>This they did until they were sheltered by a rise
of grounds, then Virg said: “Take my hand now
and we’ll race for the bunk house.”</p>

<p>Margaret felt her hand being firmly grasped and
then she was fairly dragged along the trail toward
the smaller adobe where the cow-boys had their
quarters.</p>

<p>“Oh, Virg,” the eastern girl said with sudden
terror, “Don’t go so fast. We might step on a
rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” the other responded. “This
is February and the snakes are still asleep in their
winter homes.”</p>

<p>When they reached the bunkhouse Virginia darted
to the side farthest from the dry creek and there she
paused for breath.</p>

<p>A moment later she called at an open window,
“Tom! Tom! Come out please, quickly.”</p>

<p>Puzzled by this summons at so late an hour, the
lad hastily dressed and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Miss Virginia! Miss Margaret! What does
this mean?” he exclaimed as he joined the girls.
“Why are you out at this hour and on a night so
cold and blustery? Were you frightened? Has
anything happened at the house?”</p>

<p>“No, Tom. That is—yes! Well, I will have
to begin at the beginning,” Virginia replied. Then
she rapidly told of the coming of old Uncle Tex
and of the posse that was camped in the dry creek
bottom a mile below the ranch house.</p>

<p>Then placing her hand on the lad’s arm, she
pleaded, “Tom, we girls are well protected now that
Uncle Tex has come and I beg of you ride to the
north where you will be much safer than you are
here.”</p>

<p>There was no reply and Virginia wondered if
the lad would refuse her request. Just then the
moon appeared above Inspiration Peak, and the girls
saw that in the lad’s face there was an expression of
wistfulness, almost of sorrow. Impulsively he held
out his hand. “Miss Virginia,” he said, “thank you
for your interest in me. I don’t want to go. I am
so happy here. It is the first bit of home life I have
had in many a day. You girls have been so kind.
If I had an own sister she could not be kinder. But
there is no alternative, I suppose. You know this
country better than I do, how shall I go?”</p>

<p>“I have thought it all out,” Virginia replied. “I
lay awake for hours planning what would be best
for you to do, if you had to leave suddenly, and now
that Uncle Tex has come, he has given me another
idea. First of all I want you to ride to the north,
following a trail which I will indicate, until you
come to a group of white-washed buildings. That
is the Wilson Sheep Ranch. Tell Mr. Wilson that
you have been sent from the V. M. Ranch, as an
old cattleman called Uncle Tex said that he was in
need of help. There you will be absolutely safe,
I am sure. Tom, will you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Virginia,” was the reluctant reply and the
girl noted, with a feeling of real pleasure, that for
the first time the lad had said just “Virginia.”</p>

<p>“Prepare what you need,” she added hastily, “and
I will make you a map of the trails you are to follow.”
Then to the girl who was shivering at her
side: “Come Megsy, we will return to the ranch
house.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, Virginia arose from the
old desk at which she had been busily engaged.
Margaret, who had been watching at the door,
beckoned to her friend. “Tom is coming,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Hurrying to the veranda, Virginia handed an envelope
to the lad. “Take the trail due west until
you reach the sand hills, then turn to the north,”
she said. “You ought to reach the Papago village
early in the morning and my good friend Winona
will gladly give you some breakfast. Good-bye,
Tom. We will see you again.”</p>

<p>It was this hope that the lad bore in his heart as
he rode away into the darkness and increasing wind
storm, and it was this hope which was to help him
bear the hardships and loneliness of many a day to
follow.</p>

<h2 title='A BATTLE OF WITS' id='chXXX'>
CHAPTER XXX—A BATTLE OF WITS.
</h2>

<p>When the girls went back into the house, Margaret
exclaimed, “Pinch me, Virg, will you? I
want to make sure that I am a flesh and blood person
and not a character in a book. I never felt so
strange and unreal before in all my life.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughingly placed an arm about her
friend’s waist and hugged her hard. “Won’t that
do as well as a pinch?” she inquired. “You are real
enough, dear. Hark! The clock is striking the midnight
hour. Let us return to our beds. I want to
get some sleep. I must be up at a very early hour,
for, as you know, we are expecting company for
breakfast.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Megsy,” Virginia replied. “You
will be glad to learn that our culinary troubles are
over.” Then noting her friend’s puzzled expression,
she added gaily. “We now have with us the best
cook on the desert. Uncle Tex has had charge of
the ‘chuck’ wagon at all of the roundups hereabouts
for many years and the cow-boys would rather have
him as chef than either a Frenchman or Chinaman.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then our problem of finding a cook is
solved,” Megsy said. Ten minutes later all was
quiet in the V. M. Ranch house, for the girls, truly
weary, were soon asleep.</p>

<p>The sun was streaming into Virginia’s room when
there came a rap on the door. Springing up, the girl
slipped on her robe as she called, “Who is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s yo’ Uncle Tex, Miss Virginia, dearie. Ah
has breakfast a-started, but I thought yo’ all was
a-oversleepin’ and maybe yo’d like me to call yo’.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be with you in a moment, Uncle Tex.
Thank you for calling us,” Virginia replied.</p>

<p>The girls were just emerging from their bedrooms
when Margaret, glancing through one of the
wide living-room windows, exclaimed, “Here come
six horsemen. Are they your expected guests?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Virginia replied, and she was
right. A few moments later six men of middle
age and all of them with weather-bronzed faces appeared
at the back door. The young hostess bade
them welcome with a kindly dignity and they were
soon seated about the long table at one end of the
sunny kitchen. Uncle Tex was busily making the
griddle cakes for which he was justly famous, while
Margaret and Virginia assumed the role of waitresses.</p>

<p>“Don’t your cow-boys have breakfast about this
hour?” a keen-eyed man evidently the leader of the
posse, inquired. “I understand that there’s two as
you’ve had a long time and a new one you call Tom.”</p>

<p>Margaret glanced quickly at the face of her friend
and was glad to see that Virginia was mistress of the
situation. “Yes, we have three cow-boys,” she replied
with indifference. “They left yesterday to ride
the range.”</p>

<p>This was the truth, for Tom had left just before
midnight.</p>

<p>“Which way did they all go?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” was the calm reply. “It is
not the custom of Lucky or Slim to tell me their
plans for turning back the cattle.”</p>

<p>“But this other fellow, the one you call Tom: perhaps
you know which way he went,” the man persisted.</p>

<p>“Yes, he rode toward the West,” Virginia frankly
replied, and then she added, “May I serve you to
more cakes?”</p>

<p>“A cool one for her age,” the leader of the posse
thought. “Thanks,” he said aloud, “I believe I will
have a few more.”</p>

<p>While he was eating the cakes he was trying to
think of a question that he might ask the girl that
would find her off her guard and perhaps obtain for
him the information he desired.</p>

<p>Virginia was busily refilling the huge coffee cups
which were used only by the cow-boys, when the
leader of the posse asked in a casual manner:</p>

<p>“This ranch house is one of the oldest hereabouts,
I understand. Have you any idea how long it’s been
standing Miss Davis?”</p>

<p>Virginia paused a moment before replying, but
she could see no possible trap in the query, and so
she said:</p>

<p>“It was built by my grandfather. He came from
the East in a prairie schooner when my dad was a
boy of 7.”</p>

<p>“Those were excitin’ days,” the man remarked
with seeming indifference as he continued eating.
“I suppose you’ve heard your pa tell many a time
about the Indian raids they used to have every once
in so often.”</p>

<p>This had all happened so very long ago that Virginia
was sure that the conversation was following a
safe channel, and so she replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard dad tell that when he was a
boy they were in constant dread of a raid at the
full of the moon. Every month at that time some
one’s ranch house was attacked and of course grandfather
never knew when it would be his turn to
receive one of those most unwelcome visits.”</p>

<p>“Must have been powerful uncomfortable for the
women folk those days, never knowing when they
might be scalped, but I suppose your grandad had an
underground room where he could hide his family if
he knew the Indians were coming.”</p>

<p>This had been said in an off-hand manner, but instantly
Virginia understood the meaning of the seemingly
innocent conversation.</p>

<p>The leader of the posse believed that she had
Tom hidden in the underground room which many
of the old ranches had in the days of frequent Indian
raids. They were often some distance from
the house, the entrance being well concealed.</p>

<p>Knowing, as she did, that Tom was many miles
away, Virginia calmly replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, we have an underground room. Would you
like to see it?”</p>

<p>The man looked at her keenly and then he decided
that he must be on the wrong trail, for, if this girl
really did have the supposed cow-boy Tom hidden
in an underground room, she would not so willingly
and frankly invite him to visit the place.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Davis,” he replied, as he arose; “I’ve
seen many of them and I suppose, architecturally
speaking, they are all about the same. Guess we’d
better be gettin’ on. Thanks for the grub. Good
day.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the two girls stood with their
arms about each other, watching from a wide window
as the men rode away and Virginia noticed
that they were taking the trail toward the west.
How she did hope that they would not turn north
at the sandhills, and also that Tom had not been
delayed.</p>

<p>She glanced at the clock, as she said:</p>

<p>“By now Tom ought to be safe in the Papago village.”</p>

<h2 title='WINONA, THE INDIAN MAIDEN' id='chXXXI'>
CHAPTER XXXI—WINONA, THE INDIAN MAIDEN.
</h2>

<p>Luckily for Tom’s comfort, the storm which
had threatened when he left V. M. Ranch was turned
by a changing wind toward the south; and, when the
chill grey of daylight came, he found that he had ridden
many miles to the north and that he was slowly
crossing a vast, wild broken upland, which was
gradually ascending toward a range of mountains
that looked grim, lonely and forbidding.</p>

<p>In those barren walls of rock, Virginia had told
him that he would find the almost hidden entrance
to the Papago Indian village.</p>

<p>No creature was in sight at that early hour save
a low sailing hawk, and, now and then, a lizard,
frightened by the horse’s hoofs, darted across the
trail. So near was it to the color of the sand that
only by its quick flashing motion could it be discerned.</p>

<p>As Tom neared the seemingly impenetrable wall of
rock, it was hard for him to believe that this was
really a fortress surrounding a village of any kind.
He was weary and hungry, but, try as he might, he
could not find the entrance.</p>

<div id='005' class='mt10 mb10 w005'>
  <img src='images/illus-005.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>When the two riders appeared a pack of wolf-dogs made a mad rush at the stranger.</p>
</div>

<p>Suddenly his horse snorted and stopped. Tom
wondered what it had heard for surely there was
nothing to see, but he was not long puzzled, for
a second later a lean, shaggy pony, ridden by a small
Indian boy, emerged from what seemed to be solid
rock. Tom urged his horse forward and hailed
the little fellow who, after looking at the stranger
with startled eyes, seemed about to return by the
way he had come. Then it was Tom remembered
something. He had been told to say to the first
Indian he met, “Virginia Davis sent me,” which sentence,
he had been assured would prove an open sesame
that would win for him admittance and welcome.</p>

<p>Nor had he been misinformed, for, when the small
Indian boy who was about to disappear, heard the
name which Tom called, he smiled, showing two
rows of gleaming white teeth, and then, silently
beckoning he led the way through a crevice, so narrow
that Tom no longer wondered that it had escaped
his observation.</p>

<p>It gradually widened, however, into a canyon
which at last opened into a huge bowl-shaped valley
where the grass was green and where clumps of
scarlet flowers were blossoming.</p>

<p>Scattering about were a dozen or more low adobe
huts and in the midst of them in a large corral were
many wiry Indian ponies.</p>

<p>When the two riders appeared a pack of wolf-dogs
made a mad rush at the stranger, barking furiously.
However at a word of command from the
small Indian boy, they slunk away, to Tom’s secret
relief. The lad had evidently assured them that
the intruder was a friend and not a foe.</p>

<p>The Indian boy knew little English, but he led
Tom to the most imposing of the adobe huts. There
he paused and uttered a cry like that of some wild
bird.</p>

<p>Tom gazed curiously at the open door which was
festooned with dried red peppers. He wondered
who would appear. He hoped and believed that it
would be Winona, the Indian maiden, who was
Virginia’s friend, but instead a shriveled old Indian
woman wrapped in a bright-colored blanket shuffled
to the door and evidently asked the lad what he
wished at the home of the chief.</p>

<p>Tom understood only one word in the lad’s reply
and that was “Winona.” For answer the old woman
silently pointed toward the nearest cliff. Tom,
looking in that direction, saw a graceful Indian girl
approaching and on her head she was balancing a
very large red pottery jar which was almost brimming
full of sparkling water from a mountain
spring.</p>

<p>Whirling his pony, the little Indian had galloped
toward the dusky maiden, who paused to listen to
what he had to say with an eager interest.</p>

<p>Then, placing her water jar upon a large, flat
rock, she approached the newcomer who had dismounted,
having first assured himself that the pack
of wolf-like dogs was not in evidence.</p>

<p>To his surprise the Indian maiden spoke in the
English language and, without the least embarrassment
held out her slim, dark hand as she said, “Welcome,
Virginia’s friend. You have traveled far and
are hungry. I am Winona and I will give you breakfast.”</p>

<p>Tom thanked her and, as she was about to lift the
jar again to her head, he said with his frank, friendly
smile, “I ought to offer to carry that, but I fear
I could not manage it as skillfully as you do. Since
it is without handles, it must be a difficult feat.”</p>

<p>Winona smiled up at him as they walked side by
side; the Indian lad, whose name was Red Feather,
having taken Tom’s horse to the corral.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she replied, “but we learn early and
do not forget. Look yonder.”</p>

<p>Tom’s glance followed that of Winona and he saw
a group of little Indian girls, the oldest not more
than 10. They were coming from a mountain
spring and each was balancing a water jar upon her
head. The small girls gathered about gazing half
shyly and half curiously at the newcomer, until Winona
spoke a few words in a tone of gentle rebuke,
then the little, wild, coyote-like creatures scattered
and soon disappeared in different mud huts.</p>

<p>“What did you say to them, Winona?” Tom
asked curiously.</p>

<p>The Indian girl’s smile was almost merry. “That
it isn’t manners to stare at company,” was the reply.
“For seven winters, as Virginia told you, I learned
the white man’s way, and now I have a little class
and teach what I learned. Here we are at my home.
My father awaits to welcome you.”</p>

<p>Tom saw an old Indian squatted upon the mud
porch, and about his jet-black hair was a band into
which had been woven with garnet beads the emblem
of the tribe.</p>

<p>“My father, Chief Grey Hawk, this is Tom, friend
of Virginia.” The bronzed, wrinkled face had a
kindly expression as the old man replied in his own
tongue, offering hospitality.</p>

<p>“Sit and rest and I will bring refreshment,” Winona
said as she went within, soon to return with
steaming coffee and a hard cake made from Indian
meal.</p>

<p>The chief having retired, Winona sat beside Tom
on the adobe porch and asked many questions about
Virginia.</p>

<p>An hour later Tom bade the Indian girl farewell,
and with little Red Feather as guide, he again
rode toward the north. As he looked ahead at the
rugged, uninviting mountains, in his heart there was
an impulse to whirl his horse about and gallop back
to the V. M. Ranch, whatever the consequences, but
instead he followed the lad who led the way across
an ever rising sandy waste where there was no sign
of a trail. Had there been one the frequent whirlwinds
would have hidden it with sand.</p>

<p>Tom wondered if the Indian boy had the same unerring
instinct that a bird seems to have in its flight.
Once only did the small guide pause and listen.
Tom, too, drew rein, but heard nothing, although it
was evident that the Indian lad did. He was intently
watching a sandhill nearby, around which, in another
moment, there appeared a bunch of wild,
shaggy ponies, but, upon seeing Tom and Red
Feather, with a shrill whistle-like neighing, they
whirled about and galloped in the other direction
and were soon hidden in a cloud of sand.</p>

<p>The Indian lad looked back and his white teeth
gleamed as he said, “Much pony-wild.”</p>

<p>That was his first attempt at speaking the English
language and would have surprised Tom greatly
had he not recalled that Red Feather was probably
a pupil in Winona’s little class, and so, riding closer,
he asked, “Is it far yet we go? Long way?”</p>

<p>The lad shook his head. He had understood.
“One up, one down,” was his curious reply. Tom
decided that the little fellow meant that they would
cross one more range of mountains and then
descend into a valley, nor was he wrong, for they
were soon climbing a clearly defined mountain trail
and at last reached a high point from which Tom
could see, far below them, a wide, fertile valley.</p>

<p>Red Feather drew rein and pointed. “Sheep,” he
said. “I go back.” Not waiting for Tom to express
his gratitude, and without a formal farewell,
the Indian lad returned by the way he had come.</p>

<p>Tom, believing that the sheep ranch he sought lay
in the valley below, started the descent.</p>

<p>As he neared the group of low, white-washed
buildings, Tom felt in his heart a strange loneliness
and a sense of homesickness for the V. M. Ranch.</p>

<p>After years of wandering, the few days he had
spent there had meant so much to him, but it had
been Virginia’s wish that he seek refuge on this
sheep ranch, and so he rode on, wondering what
manner of welcome he would receive.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson and his 18-year-old son, Harry, were
mounted and apparently about to ride away from
the big white-washed ranch house when they perceived
the newcomer and drew rein to await him.
They wondered who the visitor might be, as few
riders passed that way, the sheep ranch being isolated
and difficult of access.</p>

<p>When the lad was within hailing distance, Mr.
Wilson, in his bluff, hearty manner, called:</p>

<p>“Welcome, stranger!”</p>

<p>Tom responded to the greeting and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilson, I am from the V. M. Ranch. An
old cattleman, whom they call ‘Uncle Tex,’ brought
word that you were in need of help and I have come
to apply for a position.”</p>

<p>“Good! We do indeed need help,” was the hearty
response. “Have you any knowledge of sheep?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” was the frank reply, “and before
I accept a position with you, I would like to
tell you just who I am.”</p>

<p>“That is not at all necessary,” Mr. Wilson replied,
heartily. “Your honest face and manner are
all the recommendations that you need. Your past,
my boy, is past. Your present will be what you
make it now.” Then he added, “This is my son,
Harry. What shall we call you?”</p>

<p>“Tom,” was the simple reply.</p>

<p>“Tom,” Mr. Wilson repeated, “you have come at
a very opportune time. Harry and I were just setting
out for the Red Canyon camp. Our herder
there, Juan, reports that many sheep are being killed
in his flock, but that alone he cannot watch them at
all hours. Of course he must have sleep, and although
I am really needed on the home ranch, I am
so short of help that I was about to accompany
Harry. Will you go in my place?”</p>

<p>“Gladly, sir,” Tom replied.</p>

<p>“Then first come within and have refreshments
and meet the Little Mother who makes home for us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson welcomed the lad with the same
kindliness that her husband extended to him and led
him at once to the big, comfortable kitchen where
he was soon given a bountiful dinner, which he
greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>An hour later, with Harry and on a fresh mount,
Tom started again toward the north. The boys liked
each other at once. Tom was soon asking many
questions about sheep ranching, which the other lad
seemed glad to answer.</p>

<p>Then, for a time, they rode on silently. Tom was
thinking how pleased Virginia would be if she could
know of the kindly welcome he had received. How
he wished that he could write to her.</p>

<p>“Can one send a letter from here to the V. M.
Ranch?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Harry replied; “about once a month we
send our mail to Red River Junction, which is thirty
miles away. Little Francisco will go to town in
about a week.”</p>

<h2 title='A FIERCE WARRIOR' id='chXXXII'>
CHAPTER XXXII—A FIERCE WARRIOR.
</h2>

<p>A week had passed and it had been an anxious
one for Virginia and Margaret as they had no way
of knowing whether or not Tom had managed to
escape the posse that had been searching for him.
True, they had one day ridden to the Junction and
there they had learned from Mrs. Wells, the station
master’s wife, that the posse had returned to Texas,
but whether they had captured the young outlaw or
not the good woman could not tell.</p>

<p>One glorious day Margaret asked Virginia if she
would like to go for a ride but the western girl
wished to remain at home and suggested that Megsy
go for a short canter by herself.</p>

<p>“You will be perfectly safe, dear,” Virginia assured
her. “Suppose you follow the trail over the
mesa and toward the sand hills, then circle around
them and come home again. That ride will make
you good and hungry for the delicious something
that I am going to bake. Our miners are to return
tomorrow, and since Uncle Tex does not know how
to make pies, Mrs. Mahoy offered to teach me this
morning.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Margaret cantered away, feeling
very brave indeed, as this was the first time she
had started out on a desert trail all alone and unprotected.
When she reached the mesa, she drew
rein and looked about. Not a horseman was to be
seen, only the gleaming white sand with here and
there a mesquite brush, or a clump of wiry grass or
a spot of flaming color where some hardy plant was
blossoming.</p>

<p>Toward the north lay the desolate sandhills on
which tall stalks of yucca stood like silent sentinels.
Margaret decided to do as Virginia had suggested,
gallop around the small group of hills and then,
home again. How she did wish that Babs was with
her, for well she knew that her eastern schoolmate
would enjoy a canter on so glorious a morning. It
wouldn’t be long though before Babs would be coming.
“Today is the first of March,” Margaret was
thinking. “April and May will soon pass and then
it will be June and Barbara will come.”</p>

<p>Margaret was nearing the first of the three isolated
sand hills when she felt her saddle slipping.
She dismounted to tighten the girth when suddenly
she lifted her head and listened intently.</p>

<p>What had she heard? Perhaps nothing really,
for well she knew that being timid, she was very imaginative.
She fastened the girth securely and had
one foot in a stirrup about to remount when again
she heard the sound, and this time it was much
nearer than before. Leaping to her saddle, she was
about to gallop away when she saw a band of horsemen
coming around the nearest sand hill. Terrorized
she whirled her pony’s head toward the south and
urged Star to his top speed.</p>

<p>She knew by the racing hoofbeats back of her
that she was being pursued. Could she reach the
V. M. Ranch before she was overtaken?</p>

<p>Virginia was proudly surveying the row of pies,
which, with the help of Mrs. Mahoy, she had just
made, when she heard the front door burst open
and slam shut. Then, almost before she could turn
around, a terrorized girl rushed into the kitchen,
and seizing Virginia, clung to her wildly as she said,
“Oh, Virg, I was almost captured by Indians. They
came around the sand hills. The minute I saw them
I galloped for home, but two of them pursued me.
Do you suppose they are coming to raid the ranch
as you said they used to do when your father was
a boy?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Megsy, of course not,” Virginia replied.
“Tell me what did your Indian pursuers look like.”</p>

<p>“One of them was a big fierce warrior, and—”</p>

<p>Just then there was a rap at the front door. “Oh!
Oh! There they are now! Virg, you aren’t going
to let them in?”</p>

<p>“Megsy, my dear, the only Indians living near
here are the friendly Papagoes. Please do not hold
me so tight.” The western girl had to fairly drag
herself away from Margaret.</p>

<p>When the door was opened there on the porch
stood the Indian maiden, Winona, and by her side
was little Red Feather.</p>

<p>Virginia was delighted and embraced her Indian
friend just as she would have welcomed a white
girl whom she loved and had not seen for a long
time.</p>

<p>“Margaret,” she called, “come and meet my dear
friend Winona, of whom I have so often spoken.”</p>

<p>Margaret approached, feeling rather overcome by
the sudden change of emotions. She held out her
hand to the Indian girl and said sincerely that she
was indeed glad to meet Virginia’s friend. Then
she smiled at the little fellow whom she had called
a “fierce warrior.” About his straight black hair
there was a band of green, in which, perched at a
jaunty angle, was a bright red feather. The Indian
boy’s white teeth gleamed as he said admiringly:</p>

<p>“Fast pony! Go zip!”</p>

<p>Luckily neither of the Papago visitors had suspected
that Margaret had been frightened by their
sudden appearance at the sand hills.</p>

<p>“Can’t you stay awhile, Winona?” Virginia asked.</p>

<p>“Not this time. Some other, perhaps. My father,
Chief Grey Hawk, awaits me. We have buying to
do in town, but I wanted to tell you the nice young
man, your friend, he came and went again soon to
the north. Red Feather showed him the way. He
reached there safely.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s eyes glowed, and again taking the Indian
girl’s hand, she exclaimed, “Oh, Winona, I am
so glad that you stopped to tell me. We were eager
to know if Tom really found your village. It is
so hidden that the entrance is hard to find.”</p>

<p>When the farewells had been said and the two
visitors had ridden away, Margaret went to the old
writing desk, declaring that she was going to pen
Babs a letter that would make the boarding school
life seem dull and monotonous. Scarcely was the
epistle finished and sealed, when Lucky called to say
that he was riding to the Junction and would take
the mail.</p>

<p>“Be sure to bring us back some letters,” Virginia
called merrily as the cow-boy, waving his sombrero,
rode away.</p>

<h2 title='A SAND STORM' id='chXXXIII'>
CHAPTER XXXIII—A SAND STORM.
</h2>

<p>“March winds surely are blowing,” Margaret
sang out, as she and Virginia were hurled along at a
merry pace from the “hen corral,” the small fenced-in
enclosure whither the girls had been to gather
eggs.</p>

<p>When they reached the shelter of the kitchen, Virginia
declared, “It’s great fun to race with the wind
back of one, but I wouldn’t care to go far across the
desert facing this gale. I suppose that it will blow
now for days and days. It usually does in March.
Sometimes it hurls the sand against our windows in
terrific gusts and woe to the horseman who is caught
out in a such a storm.”</p>

<p>“What happens? Is he buried alive?” Margaret
asked.</p>

<p>“No, not often that. Sometimes he turns and
rides with the wind until it has abated. Let’s get
the darning basket, shall we? This is such a cozy
time to sit by the fire and mend. I always enjoy it
most when there is a storm outside, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the two girls were comfortably
curled up in easy chairs in front of the wide
grate on which a mesquite root was cheerfully burning.
Margaret, dropping her darning into her lap
sat watching the flames.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts,” Virginia teased.
Margaret looked up with a little laugh. “Virg,” she
said, “my thoughts had gone way back to the first
chapter. I was thinking how I had rebelled when
you wrote that I would have to leave boarding
school and come out here to live on the desert. I
was so sure that I was leaving happiness behind me
and that I would be miserable ever after, but instead—”
she paused.</p>

<p>“Have you been unhappy, dear, and are you hiding
it in your heart?” Virginia asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Unhappy?” Margaret lifted such a glowing face
that Virginia felt that her question was answered before
the next words were uttered. “I have never
been so happy before in all my life. This is the
first real home that I ever had. Mother died when
I was so very young, and then father placed me in
boarding school, and then he died. Of course I was
happy at Vine Haven and Babs was like a dear sister,
but Oh, Virginia, there’s nothing like a comfortable,
love-filled house for a home, is there? Of
course I still love Babs, and now I have you, and
Malcolm for a brother.”</p>

<p>Margaret had returned her attention to the sock
she was darning which chanced to belong to the lad
she had just mentioned, and she smiled as she continued,
“How nice Malcolm is. But isn’t he much
more serious than most boys of eighteen? Is it because
he has had so much responsibility since your
father died?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, and also because he is of a serious
nature,” Virginia replied, as she threaded a needle.
“And yet there is lots of fun in Buddy. You haven’t
had an opportunity to become acquainted with him.
He has been so occupied since you came. If he does
return to V. M. Ranch tomorrow I do hope he plans
staying at home for a while. He has been away
now for two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Whew-oo!” Margaret said with a shudder.
“Virg, did you hear that gust of wind? It’s blowing
the sand, and how dark it is getting!”</p>

<p>Virginia glanced anxiously at the window. “I do
hope Lucky will reach here before nightfall,” she
said. “However, he may remain all night at the Junction.
That would be the wise thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” Margaret exclaimed listening intently,
“I’m sure I heard someone calling just then. Did
you?”</p>

<p>They both listened but heard only the rush of the
wind and sand.</p>

<p>However, a moment later, there came a rapping
on the back door and both girls dropping their darning,
hurried to see who the newcomer might be.</p>

<p>As they had really expected, it was the cow-boy
who had ridden to the Junction for the mail.</p>

<p>“Lucky!” Virginia remonstrated, “you are
covered with sand and your face is almost bleeding.
Why did you come out tonight? The mail was not
so important.”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Virginia, ’twant the mail that fetched
me but the stock. Slim ain’t here and I hadn’t tol’
Uncle Tex about the little sick heifer as I’ve got
down in the hospital. I knew it would be dead by
morning if I didn’t come home to tend to it.” As
the long, lank cow-boy talked, he was taking the
mail from the pouch and placing it on the kitchen
table. At first he seemed puzzled, and then troubled
about something. He turned the mailbag upside
down and shook it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Lucky? Have you lost something?”
Virg inquired.</p>

<p>“I’m afeared I have, Miss Virginia,” the cow-boy
replied. “I know as how I had five letters for V.
M. Ranch, but now I don’t count but four. One of
’em must have blowed away. I’m powerful sorry,
Miss Virginia. It was a longish one and it was
from Red Riverton, I just don’t see where that letter
can be.”</p>

<p>The poor cow-boy was so distressed that Virginia
assured him that the missive was of no great
importance and that probably it would be found
in the morning.</p>

<p>Then, returning to the living-room the girls drew
their chairs close to the center table where Virginia
had lighted the lamp with its cheerful crimson
shade.</p>

<p>“Where did Lucky say the lost letter was from?”
Margaret asked as she slipped a gourd into the toe
of one of Malcolm’s socks. “I had never heard of
the place before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I imagine it is a letter from some neighboring
rancher to my brother,” Virginia remarked as
she took up her darning. “Red Riverton is in the
northern part of the state, and—”</p>

<p>“Virg!” Margaret interrupted, “do you suppose
that letter was from our Tom? Or rather I should
say, your Tom, as he never seems conscious of my
existence.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s eyes glowed and springing up she exclaimed,
“I do believe that you may be right. I’ll
ask Uncle Tex the name of the nearest postoffice to
the Wilson Sheep Ranch.” Into the kitchen she
skipped returning with a woe-begone expression.
“You are right, and, Oh Megsy, isn’t it dreadful?
We have lost the very first letter that Tom ever
wrote to us, for of course it must be blown far away.
Just listen to that wind. It is traveling sixty miles
an hour or more and by this time the letter will
be far over the Mexican border. I am just sure we
never will find it.”</p>

<p>“It might have been caught on a thorny cactus,”
Margaret said, but neither of the girls had any real
hope of finding the missive in which they were so
interested.</p>

<p>During the night the wind subsided and the next
day dawned gloriously still and sunny. The cow-boy,
Lucky, arose before daybreak and rode up to
the mesa, searching everywhere for the lost letter
until the bell on the back porch of the ranch house
called him to breakfast.</p>

<p>When he entered the kitchen, he looked so
troubled that Virginia said with her friendly smile,
“Don’t you worry about that letter. If it doesn’t
turn up, I know who sent it, and I will write and
explain that it was blown away in a sand storm.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the two girls tramped over every
bit of sand between the ranch house and the corrals;
then they mounted their ponies and rode over
the trail toward the Junction, but not a gleam of
white did they see.</p>

<p>“How the sand has changed!” Margaret exclaimed.
“It is lying in billow-like waves. It isn’t
smooth, the way it was yesterday.”</p>

<p>“That is how the three little sand hills were
formed, I suppose,” Virginia remarked. “Something
must have been there, a giant cactus, perhaps
around which the sand first gathered, and then, being
held, other storms added to it until the mounds
became quite sizable sand hills standing all alone
on the desert, but these little waves have nothing to
hold them and they will soon smooth out again.”</p>

<p>At noon they gave up the search and returned for
lunch. As they entered the house, Margaret suddenly
exclaimed, “Why, Virginia, how could that
letter have blown away? Lucky took the mail out
of the pouch right here in the kitchen and before
that the flap was buckled down.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Virginia replied, “and yet he remembers
having had it and I have looked in the
pouch several times.” Then, chancing to glance out
of the window, she laughingly added, “You’d better
hide, Margaret, for here comes your fierce warrior
and he may be after your curly scalp.”</p>

<p>Megsy took the teasing good naturedly and both
girls went out on the veranda to see what message
little Red Feather had for them.</p>

<p>Far on the mesa they saw a gray line of horsemen
whom they knew were the Papagoes returning
to their mountain encircled home. Probably Winona
had sent the Indian boy down to the V. M.</p>

<p>As the little fellow rode up, he reached under his
red saddle blanket and drew forth a long white envelope.
This he handed to Virginia with a slip of
brown wrapping paper on which Winona had written:</p>


<p class='ni mt10'>“Dear White Lily:</p>

<p class='mb10'>“Mrs. Wells sent this. Your cow-boy dropped it
at the station. Your friend, <span class='sc'>Winona</span>.”</p>


<p>“Oh thank you, Red Feather!” Virginia exclaimed,
when she had read the message. “Tell Winona
to come soon again and pay us a real visit.”</p>

<p>The little Indian lad showed his white teeth in
a wide smile but whether he understood or not the
girls could not tell.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Virginia dragged Margaret
into the living-room and whirled her about merrily.
Then they sank down on the window seat and Virginia
tore open the long white envelope.</p>

<h2 title='TWO LETTERS FROM TOM' id='chXXXIV'>
CHAPTER XXXIV—TWO LETTERS FROM TOM.
</h2>

<p>“A letter from an outlaw,” Margaret laughingly
exclaimed as the two girls curled up on the window
seat, one to read and the other to listen to their
very first letter from Tom.</p>

<p>“Virginia, isn’t this the strangest thing you ever
heard of?” Margaret added. “What would my
primly and properly brought up friends in Vine
Haven Seminary think if they knew that we were
corresponding with a young man labeled an outlaw
whose last name we do not even know?”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed. “I suppose your Miss Pickle
would be frigid with horror, but luckily she knows
nothing of your present misdemeanors and cannot
make you go without dessert for a week for breaking
a rule. Now for the letter:</p>


<p class='mt10 ni'>“Dear Virginia and Margaret:</p>

<p>“Greetings from a sheep ranch. Virginia, when I
was outlawed from your home, I felt that I was leaving
the sunshine of the world behind me and I didn’t
much care what happened, but you will be glad to
know that my destination proved to be a real home
where I was kindly welcomed by a motherly woman,
her big hearted, splendid husband and their son,
Harry, who is just my age. I offered at once to
tell them who I really am, but they would not permit
me to do so. Luckily for me, Mr. Wilson was in
great need of help and within an hour after my arrival,
his son Harry and I started to ride to the
Red Canyon Camp where the sheep herder, Juan,
was alone with several hundred ewes.</p>

<p>“A very small Mexican boy with a very big name,
it being Francisco Quintano Mendoza, is ranch rider.
It is his duty to visit each of the four outlying
camps, which he does on his brisk little burro, finding
out the needs of each herder and then he returns
to the main ranch house. It takes him a week to
make the round trip. He had ridden in that morning
with a message from Juan of Red Canon Camp.
The flock was being nightly attacked by wild
animals, and, try as he might, the herder had been
unable to capture the invader.</p>

<p>“‘Of course even a sheep herder must sleep part
of the time,’ Harry declared as we rode through a
valley that was covered with dry grama grass. Close
to the mountains we came to the herder’s hut, which
consisted of one earth-roofed adobe room, a stove,
two bunks, a rude table and bench were the only
furnishings, while strings of dry red peppers were
the decorations. Juan was farther up the valley
with the flock, but toward sundown, he came driving
the sheep into the sheltered corral. Harry at once
saw that something was wrong with the herder. The
faithful shepherd had broken his arm and was enduring
much pain, but he would not leave his flock
until someone came to care for it. Harry skilfully
bandaged the broken arm and then bade Juan ride
at once to a physician in Red Riverton. He is to
leave now as soon as he has his supper, which
Harry is preparing; so I must end this letter that I
may send it by Juan.</p>

<p>“Harry and I are going to take turns watching
the flock. How I do hope that I will be able to catch
the wolf or mountain lion that is killing the sheep.
I would like to prove my gratitude to Mr. Wilson
by some helpful deed.</p>

<p class='mb10'>“Virginia, how may I show my gratitude to you?
Will you let me know? Your outlaw, <span class='sc'>Tom</span>.”</p>

<p>“What an interesting letter!” Virginia exclaimed;
“I am so glad that the Wilsons are being so kind to
him.”</p>

<p>Several days later the girls were surprised to
receive another letter from Tom. They were riding
on the mesa trail when Slim came from town with
the mail. There were several letters for each of
them and so eager were they to read them that they
dismounted and bidding their ponies return to the
home ranch, the girls sat on the sun-warmed sand
and looked over the mail.</p>

<p>“A letter from Babs!” Margaret exclaimed happily.</p>

<p>“And another from Tom, so soon!” Virginia said.
“Which shall we read first?”</p>

<p>“Tom’s, of course,” Margaret replied, “Babs
won’t mind waiting.” So Virg began to read aloud.</p>


<p class='mt10'>“Dear Virginia and Margaret: I have had such
an exciting adventure and I want to tell you about
it. Last night Harry permitted me to watch the
flock, as he had done the night before, but without
discovering the invader. In fact, when he came to
the cabin to breakfast, he told me that nothing had
happened to disturb the sheep, and yet, an hour
later, when he drove the flock to the valley pasture
we found that two of the best ewes had been killed
on the far north side, so it was there that I determined
to hide and watch. That part is nearest the
Red Canyon which is a narrow gorge of red rock
leading into the mountains.</p>

<p>“I crouched in the shelter of an overhanging ledge
behind a scrub pine and waited. The hours dragged
by but nothing happened. It must have been about
midnight when I thought that I heard soft, stealthy
footfalls as though made by padded feet. Too, the
sheep nearest me became fidgety and stood up facing
the canyon. The wind evidently had brought a
scent to them that they feared.</p>

<p>“I arose, and leaning on one knee with my gun
ready to fire, I watched the opening of the canyon
intently, expecting to see a dark figure appear, or,
cat-like eyes gleaming in the dark, but nothing happened.
Suddenly something impelled me to look up,
and it was well that I did, or I would not be writing
this letter to you, for there on the jutting ledge, was
a lion crouched to spring, not at the sheep, but at
me. I whirled to shoot, but in that moment the
creature leaped. By turning, however, I had
changed my position and the lion leaped beyond me.</p>

<p>“Instantly it was upon me, however, but I had
time to lift my gun, and it leaped against the muzzle.
‘What if the gun should fail me?’ I thought,
but it didn’t, and the lion fell over.</p>

<p>“I sat down again to wait for dawn, feeling none
too secure, and glancing often at the ledge over
my head for where there is one mountain lion, there
might be another, but nothing happened, and when
day dawned, Harry rode over and found me sitting
beside the largest dead lion, he said, that he had
ever seen. The creature had torn the right sleeve
almost out of my coat and my arm was scratched
but the sheep were all there.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Virginia, it makes a chap feel that he
is not entirely useless in this world when he can do
something that really helps.</p>

<p class='mb10'>“We are back at the home ranch now; another
herder, Josef Lopez, having ridden in from Red
Riverton to take Juan’s place for two weeks. Little
Francisco Quintano Mendoza is about to ride into
town with the mail, so I will say good-bye now.
How I do hope, when he returns, that he will have a
letter for me from you. Greetings from your
outlaw, <span class='sc'>Tom</span>.”</p>


<p>Virg paused and gazed intently at the signature.</p>

<p>Margaret inquired:</p>

<p>“What do you see, Virg? Hieroglyphics that you
find hard to decipher?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is something puzzling,” the western girl
declared. “I believe that Tom first signed another
name to this letter, and then, remembering that his
real name was to be kept a secret, known only to
himself, he has carefully erased it, but even so there
is a faint lining of letters perceptible. How I do
wish that we could make them out, although, perhaps
we ought not to pry into Tom’s secret if he
does not wish to share it with us.”</p>

<p>“May I look at the signature?” Megsy asked.
Virginia gave her the letter, and Margaret taking
the sheet of paper held it up to the sun.</p>

<p>After gazing at it intently for several seconds,
she uttered a squeal of excited delight. “Virginia,”
she announced, “I am just sure that I can make
out the capital letter beginning the last name. See!
It’s a W, isn’t it? There can be no mistake as to
that.”</p>

<p>Virginia also looked and although none of the
others could be recognized, she too, was convinced
that the last name began the letter her friend had
mentioned.</p>

<p>Suddenly Margaret turned toward her, with eyes
that glowed.</p>

<p>“Virginia Davis,” she exclaimed excitedly, “has it
ever entered your thought even remotely that our
Tom might be Peyton Wente, the lost brother of
Babs?”</p>

<p>“Why no, dear. It never had,” Virginia replied.
“Do you suppose that it might be possible? And
yet, if it were true, we wouldn’t want to tell Babs
that the brother whom she so adores is a fugitive
from justice.”</p>

<p>“No, we wouldn’t,” Margaret reluctantly admitted.
Then, after a thoughtful moment, she
added, “but I would like to know for our own sake,
wouldn’t you, Virg?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” the western girl agreed. “The
more I know of Tom the more I am convinced that
he belongs to a refined family, and I also believe
there is a mistake about the mysterious something
for which he is an outlaw from Texas.”</p>

<p>“I know what let’s do,” Margaret exclaimed
brightly, “let’s ask Babs to send a photograph of
her brother, telling her merely that many lads drift
West, lured by the fascination of life on the desert,
and that if her brother should happen to be among
them, we would want to be able to recognize him.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good plan,” Virginia agreed.
“Now, suppose you read the letter from Babs. I
hope it isn’t feeling offended because it has been kept
waiting.”</p>

<h2 title='NEWS FROM SCHOOL' id='chXXXV'>
CHAPTER XXXV—NEWS FROM SCHOOL.
</h2>

<p>Virginia settled comfortably on the warm sand
still holding the letter from Tom while Margaret
eagerly opened the plump epistle from her best
friend in the far away East.</p>

<p>“I just love to get these chatty letters from Babs,”
she prefaced and then read:</p>

<div class='tar mt10' style='margin-right:2em'>“Vine Haven Seminary,</div>
<div class='tar'>“March 15, 1922.</div>
<p class='ni'>“Dearest Cowgirls:</p>

<p>“Megsy, you remember how prim and proper Miss
Pickle was when you were here at school and how
‘skeered’ of her we girls always were. Well, some
mysterious power is surely working a transformation.
I told you about the Surprise Valentine party
she gave for us and how we entertained young Prof.
Pixley and thirteen of the boys from the Drexel
Military Academy. Well, ever since that night Miss
Piqulin has been kindlier in her manner; she hasn’t
done her hair up quite so tight and she even attempted
a joke in algebra class. We girls hardly
dared laugh, however, but yesterday something happened
to convince us that Miss Piqulin can be called
the sour Miss Pickle no longer.</p>

<p>“It was her birthday and it was also mine. It
being Saturday Miss Piqulin decided to celebrate
and she invited her algebra class to spend the day in
the city with her. Weren’t we excited though? You
know our club, ‘The Lucky Thirteen,’ (we asked
Jennie Clark to join when you left school that we
might keep the same number), are all in that class.
We decked up in our very best and looked pretty
nice, so we thought, when we gathered in the lower
corridor to await the coming of the school bus.
Betsy Closson was the last down and she seemed
excited about something. ‘Girls,’ she said, ‘watch
Miss Martin’s office door.</p>

<p>“‘A strange young lady just went in there and
she had on the prettiest spring suit. It’s the very latest
style. I wonder who—’ Betsy said no more for
the office door was opening. The strange young lady
appeared with her back toward us, but suddenly she
turned, and if it wasn’t our very own Miss Pickle.
She had on the prettiest grey suit and a grey tulle
hat trimmed with crushed pink roses.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we stared our astonishment, but luckily
the bus arrived just then and so we went out and
climbed in. Miss Piqulin was with Patrick on the
front seat but she smiled at us over her shoulder.
We sat there in two rows as solemn as though we
were at a funeral.</p>

<p>“‘Girls,’ Miss Pickle said, ‘have a happy time;
laugh and chatter all you want to.’</p>

<p>“Megsy, did you ever suppose the day would
dawn when Miss Pickle would say that? Well,
anyway, she did, so we started to sing a school song
when suddenly Betsy Closson held up one hand and
said, ‘Hark! Don’t you hear bugles?’</p>

<p>“‘Look! Look!’” Jenny Clark was pointing back
at the bend in the road. ‘There comes a carryall
and it’s filled with boys from the Drexel Military
Academy. Don’t they look nice in their dress uniforms?’</p>

<p>“‘That jolly young Professor Pixley is with
them,’ Flora Wells added. Miss Piqulin heard this
and her cheeks became as pink as the roses on
her hat. The mystery was solved. Miss Pickle is
in love!</p>

<p>“Well, to make a long story short, the carryall
dashed up and both vehicles stopped while greetings
were exchanged. When Prof. Pixley heard that we
were to spend the day in town, he asked us to join
them at a theater party at two in the afternoon.
Weren’t we girls excited and delighted, and what a
fine time we did have! I sat next to such a nice
boy and Virg, how pleased I was when he said that
his home is in Arizona. His name is Benjamin Wilson.
Have you ever heard of him?</p>

<p>“That was a whole lot of excitement for boarding
school girls all in one day, wasn’t it Megsy? Nor
was that all, for when I reached my room that
night, I found a birthday box from China. In it
was a pale blue silk kimono embroidered with pink
cherry blossoms and slippers to match. It was from
my dear brother Peyton. He has never missed giving
me something on my birthday. Now that I
know where he is, I am so happy and content.</p>

<p class='mb10'>“Farewell for now. Your <span class='sc'>Babs</span>.”</p>


<p>“Then after all our Tom isn’t Peyton Wente,”
Margaret said as they started walking toward the
V. M. Ranch.</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed,” Megsy continued. “I did hope
your outlaw would turn out to be—well—somebody
just ever so nice and of course even if he did run
away from a very stern father, Peyton Wente must
be nice, else how could he be my adorable Barbara’s
brother?”</p>

<p>“That argument can’t be disputed.” Virginia
said, then leaping to her feet she added: “Let’s go
home, dear, I’m hungry as a lean coyote! How I
do hope that Uncle Tex will have a fine dinner waiting
for us.”</p>

<p>Upon reaching the ranch house the girls went at
once to their rooms to prepare for the midday
meal, but when the Chinese gongs rang, they sallied
forth arm in arm and were confronted by a young
giant of a lad.</p>

<p>“Malcolm Davis, are you home at last?” Virginia
fairly flew at her dearly loved brother, and was
caught in his arms. Then turning, the smiling
young man, held out his right hand to Margaret.</p>

<p>“I feel as though I ought to be introduced to my
ward all over again,” he said with his pleasant smile.
“I have been away at the mines for so long that I
have hardly had time to become acquainted with
her. Has she been a dutiful ward?”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled at her friend as she replied, “Oh,
Malcolm, you can’t know what a comfort Margaret
is to me. We two girls do have the nicest times
together.”</p>

<p>Then, when they were seated about the table, Slim
having been detained at the corral and Lucky still
being out on the range, Malcolm remarked, “Slim
tells me that Tom is not here now. Did you have
cause to dismiss him from our service, sister?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Buddie,” was the earnest reply.
“Tom proved to be as trustworthy as you believed
that he would, but, for some reason, he seems to be
a fugitive from justice as he told you. We advised
him to go farther north, but he would not leave the
V. M. until we girls were well protected. That very
night Uncle Tex returned telling us that Mr. Wilson
up Red Riverton way needed help on his sheep
ranch and so we urged Tom to go. We have had
two splendid letters from him. He seems to be
enjoying his work up there and he likes the Wilson
family just ever so much. Do you know them, Buddie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I do. I often stayed all night with
the Wilsons when I was one of dad’s range riders,
and when I had gone that far north in search of
strayed cattle. Of course the cowmen and the sheep
ranchers are supposed to be bitter enemies, but my
theory is that there is room enough in our big state
for all of us to live and let live. The Wilsons are
the nicest kind of a family, Virg. Mrs. Wilson is
a dear, mothering sort who reminds me of a hen
with wide, warm wings that can always take one
more chick in out of the cold. Dad thought very
highly of Mr. Wilson, and then, there are two sons.
One of them, Harry, is about my age and there is
a younger chap. I think he is nearly sixteen. He
was fonder of books than Hal and so they sent
him East to school. I can’t recall his name.”</p>

<p>“Was it Benjamin?” Virginia asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. Benjy, his mother called him. I
haven’t ridden that far north for two years at least.
However, I hope that I will get up that way some
day. I like to keep in touch with such kindly neighbors.”</p>

<p>Malcolm then told the girls about the progress
made at the mine.</p>

<p>“I am very much encouraged with the output,” he
told Virginia, “but I am a rancher, not a miner, and
so I asked Pat Mahoy to send for his former associates
in Bisbee to assist him. I can trust Pat to
look after our interests as he will his own. I will
stay at home for a time and get acquainted with
my ward and my sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh brother, I am so glad, and some day will you
take us for a long, long ride? I am eager to have
Margaret see more of our wonderful desert.”</p>

<p>“That’s a splendid suggestion,” Malcolm said
with enthusiasm. “We might even ride as far north
as the Wilson Ranch.”</p>

<p>Although Virginia’s reply expressed her pleasure,
it did not reveal to her brother how very much she
did hope that plan would soon be carried out.</p>

<h2 title='CAUGHT IN A TORRENT' id='chXXXVI'>
CHAPTER XXXVI—CAUGHT IN A TORRENT.
</h2>

<p>A month had passed. The wild March winds
had blown itself out. The spring rains had filled
the usually dry creek with a rushing, raging torrent
which could be forded by neither man nor beast.
Then, when at last the sun shone out, the desert
glistened, while here and there a clump of bright
flowers gleamed. The sand had been washed from
cactus and mesquite and there were fresh leaves
on the cottonwood trees. Birds sang, and also there
was a rejoicing in the hearts of the two girls who
had been so long held prisoners by the inclement
weather.</p>

<p>“Think of it!” Margaret said as she swept the
veranda the first clear morning after the rains. “It
is three weeks since any one has been for the mail.
Do you suppose that it would be safe for us to
cross the creek today and ride to the Junction?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure that it would,” Virginia replied.
“There isn’t a cloud anywhere to be seen and isn’t
the sky the shiniest, gleamingest blue?”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when their morning tasks
were finished, Virg hailed her brother, who was on
his way to the valley pasture to see what damage
had been done to the mile square fence. “Buddy,”
she called, “is it safe for Margaret and me to ride
to the Junction for the mail? There must be just
stacks of it there waiting for us?”</p>

<p>The lad scanned the horizon and replied in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>The two ponies, Star and Comrade had been in
the corral so long that they were high spirited and
galloped across the hard, desert trail as though
racing with each other.</p>

<p>Having reached the rocky creek bottom, where
only a little water was trickling along, Virginia
turned her pony toward the opposite bank where
she expected to find the trail which they had always
ascended but it had been washed away leaving a
steep perpendicular cliff, up which they could not
ride.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” Margaret asked. “Is there
no other way to reach the Junction?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is another trail farther up the creek,
but, to reach it we will have to ride between these
high banks for about a mile. At this time of the
year it is rather a risky thing to do, for if there
should be a cloudburst in the mountains, we would
find ourselves in a raging torrent, but since brother
assured us that it is not going to rain, suppose
we take the chance.”</p>

<p>Margaret agreed and silently they rode along the
creek bottom. On either side of them the banks rose
sheer and high. Virginia felt strangely troubled.
She almost wished they had not taken the chance.
They were within sight of the low banks, when Virginia
suddenly drew rein and listened intently.
Somewhere, up in the mountains ahead of them, she
heard a sullen, roaring noise. What could it be?
There was no wind and the sky was clear. Intuitively,
however, the western girl knew that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>“Megsy,” she called, “ride as fast as you can.”
The creek bottom was covered with stones of all
sizes and the eastern girl, frightened by Virginia’s
command, urged her horse to greater speed. The
dull roaring in the mountains grew louder and
louder. Then, there was a report like a crash of
thunder.</p>

<p>Virginia was only two lengths from the low bank
when a rush of water hurled past them. It had risen
to the stirrups when Comrade with a frightened
snort, started to climb the low bank. Virginia looked
back, and to her dismay she saw that Star had
reared and that Margaret was about to be thrown
into the swirling ever-deepening torrent. Seizing
Margaret’s bridle, she called: “Let go of the rein,
Megsy, and cling to Star’s neck. It’s your only
chance.”</p>

<p>She again scrambled up the low bank with Star in
tow and not a minute too soon, for following the
last booming noise in the mountains, a mad rushing
torrent was hurled down the creek, overflowing the
low bank.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape,” Virginia had just
said when Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their young son,
Davie, rushed out of the station house to see what
had happened.</p>

<p>“It’s the new Pine Canyon reservoir that’s burst!”
the excited man exclaimed, then he added, “Miss
Virginia, you gals wasn’t a ridin’ along the creek bottom,
was ye?” When Virg replied in the affirmative,
he ejaculated, “Wall, I’ll be jigger-switched. You
sure had a narrow call, but if its mail as yer after
there’s a stack of it for ye.”</p>

<p>Kind Mrs. Wells led the way indoors and gave
each of the girls a cup of steaming coffee. As soon
as the flood had passed, Malcolm and Slim, with
anxious faces, appeared, and how relieved they were
to find that the girls were safe. The cow-boy
shouldered the bulging mail bag and they returned
home by another trail.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex opened the ranch house door to admit
them, and Virg felt his hand tremble in her clasp.</p>

<p>“Miss Virginia, dearie,” he said in a quivering
voice, “don’t yo’ be doin’ reckless things any more.
If yo’r wantin’ the mail, send yo’ old Uncle Tex.
He’d ruther be swept away in a torrent than be livin’
without ye.”</p>

<p>The old man was almost overcome with emotion
and the girl whom he had trotted on his knee as a
baby, kissed him tenderly on his wrinkled leathery
cheek. “Dear Uncle Tex,” she said. “I’m sorry
we worried you all so much. We won’t take chances
again. Honest Injun;” and then in a higher tone,
she added, “We’re powerful hungry. Have you
something nice for us?”</p>

<p>“That I have Miss Virginia dearie, an’ ah’ll open
up a can of the preserved strawberries yo’ all like so
much.”</p>

<p>The young people did justice to the good meal,
and, when the last delicious strawberry had been
eaten Virginia sprang up, quite her old self again
as she said, “Now brother Malcolm, let’s open the
mail bag.”</p>

<p>They went into the living-room and the young
giant of a lad unbuckled the cover of the pouch and
shook the letters and papers out on the library table.
Margaret pounced upon one addressed in Bab’s
familiar scrawl. Although Virginia received several
letters from girl friends who were away at school,
there was not a line from Tom. She was surprised
to realize how truly disappointed she was, and, not
feeling in a mood to read chattery letters from girl
friends just then, she picked up one of the papers,
and, sitting on the sunny window seat she idly
glanced it over. Margaret was about to read the
letter from Babs, when an excited exclamation from
her friend sent her hurrying to her side as she inquired.
“What is it, Virg? What have you found
in the paper?”</p>

<p>For answer the western girl sprang up and seizing
the astonished Margaret, she whirled her about as
she exclaimed gaily. “I knew it. I knew it all the
time.”</p>

<p>“Knew what?” asked the mystified Megsy. For
answer Virginia drew her friend down on the window
seat and then read aloud an astonishing bit of
news.</p>

<div class='tac mt05 mb05'>“WANTED, ONE TOM WENTWORTH.”</div>

<p>“When I read that heading I was sure at once
that it referred to our Tom,” Virg said.</p>

<p>“And does it?” Megsy asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Read along and decide for yourself,” her friend
replied and so Margaret bent her head over the sheet
and read aloud:</p>

<p>“To all whom it may concern, and to the young
man calling himself Tom Wentworth in particular,
this article is addressed: Be it known that a Mexican,
Miguel Lopez, on his death-bed confessed to
having been guilty of a crime, the circumstantial evidence
of which he cleverly turned upon an innocent
bystander who has ever since (being unable to prove
his innocence) been a fugitive from justice. Tom
Wentworth, a young man of about eighteen is tall,
slim, with wavy light brown hair and blue-grey eyes.</p>

<p>“When last heard of he was hiding in The Seven
Peak Range just across the Mexican border in Arizona.
Anyone reading this article who has knowledge
of the whereabouts of the young man in question,
will confer a favor upon the state authorities
of Texas if he or she will inform the same that
he is no longer held guilty of the crime which was
unjustly attributed to him.”</p>

<p>“There!” Virginia exclaimed. “Now what do
you think of that?”</p>

<p>“It surely must mean our Tom,” Megsy began.
Then she added excitedly, “Oh, Virg, I was right,
wasn’t I? Tom’s last names does begin with W,
but it is Wentworth and not Wente. However, it is
curious, isn’t it, that he and Babs have last names
so near alike?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded. “Now,” she said, “the big
question is, how shall we get this glorious news to
Tom in the shortest possible time?”</p>

<p>“It surely can’t be done tonight,” Margaret, said
as she lighted the lamp with its warm crimson shade,
“for it is nearly dark.” Then she added, “Isn’t there
some way to telephone to the Wilson Ranch?”</p>

<p>Virg shook her head. “No,” she replied, “distances
are so great here on the desert that the only
telephone lines are those that have been erected by
neighbors for their own private use. Our telephone
connects us with the Dartley ranch and was put up
merely for protection in case either of us might be
in urgent need of assistance.”</p>

<p>Then as she seated herself by the table, Virg said,
“When Malcolm comes in we’ll ask his advice. Oh,
I am so happy about it! How I wish I might be
with Tom when he hears the goods news that I
might see his face glow when he realizes that he is
no longer a fugitive from justice. But who is your
letter from?”</p>

<p>“Another plump epistle from Babs!” Megsy replied.
“Shall I read it to you?” Virg nodded in the
affirmative and took up her sewing. Margaret unfolded
the truly voluminous letter and began reading
another chapter in the life of Babs at the Vine
Haven Boarding School.</p>

<h2 title='AN APRIL FOOL ROMANCE' id='chXXXVII'>
CHAPTER XXXVII—AN APRIL FOOL ROMANCE.
</h2>

<div class='tar mt10' style='margin-right:2em'>“Vine Haven Seminary,</div>
<div class='tar'>“April 4, 1922.</div>
<p class='ni'>“Dearest Cowgirls:</p>

<p>You never could guess what has happened since
I wrote you last and, since you are too far away
for me to really enjoy mystifying you, I will tell
you all about it.</p>

<p>Well, to begin at the beginning. You know there
are certain girls in this school who have always
wished that they could be members of “The Lucky
13,” but, for various reasons, we have not wished
to enlarge our membership nor include these particular
girls, and so they formed a club of their own
and called it “The Exclusive Three.” Then, if you
please, they actually told around that we had invited
them to become members of our club, but that they
had refused since some of our fathers were tradespeople,
while all of their fathers are retired gentlemen.</p>

<p>Of course, you know, that sort of snobbishness
never impresses “The Lucky Thirteen.” We took it
all as a joke and were glad they were to have a club
of their own, for we want everyone to be happy.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Piquilin happens to have the entire
membership of these rival clubs in her algebra class,
and, since the members of “The Exclusive Three”
are not very studious, they often fail in their lessons.
The consequence is that while Miss Piquilin
is just dear to “The Lucky Thirteen,” she is still
Miss Pickle at her sourest to “The Exclusive Three.”
It seems that they decided to punish her by playing a
practical joke on April Fools’ Day. We found out
about it in this way. I went down to the library
one evening to get a reference book. I didn’t turn
on the light for I knew exactly where the book stood
on the shelf. Just as I was reaching for it, I heard
whispered voices in the portiere-covered alcove and
I recognized Rose Hedge’s voice. She was saying:
“We’ll get even with that sour Miss Pickle.
She’s in love with Professor Pixley at the Drexel
Military Academy. As though he would even look
at her!”</p>

<p>Then I heard Hattie Drew ask: “How shall we
get even, Rose?” I did want to stay and hear the
answer, but mother has taught me that it is as
wrong to listen to a conversation not intended for
my ears as it is to steal something that does not belong
to me, and so, having found the book, I left the
room without having made my presence known.</p>

<p>I told the members of “The Lucky Thirteen” that
the girls in “The Exclusive Three” were plotting
some April Fool mischief against poor Miss Piquilin
and we all decided that it was a mean shame if those
spiteful girls succeeded in doing anything to shatter
the budding romance.</p>

<p>We guessed this and surmised that, but, of course,
we had no way of really knowing what those girls
planned doing.</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” said Betsy Clossen, “I do wish it were
not dishonorable to listen. Don’t you think that
sometimes the end justifies the means?”</p>

<p>“Never!” Kittie Squires said so emphatically that
we all jumped. Kittie seldom speaks but when she
does, it’s right to the point.</p>

<p>“Well, then, what shall we do?” Jennie Clark
asked. “Miss Piquilin has been so kind to us, it
doesn’t seem right for us not to make an effort to
save her romance from being shattered.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me!” Betsy Clossen said. “I’ll find
a way.” When Betsy spoke in that tone of voice,
we all knew she would accomplish whatever she set
out to do. We were curious to know how she would
go about it, but it was April the first before we
found out.</p>

<p>We girls played all of the regulation jokes, the
same ones that are played every year. We bought
candy that had cotton inside of a delicious chocolate
coating; we slipped into each other’s closets and
sewed up sleeves, but those things were tame compared
to what happened during the two o’clock
study hour.</p>

<p>Dora Wells had put a small green toad into Kittie
Squire’s desk. I will never forget the terrorized cry
that shrilled through the silence when that timid girl
opened her desk and the equally frightened little
frog, giving a leap for liberty, landed, first in Kittie’s
lap, and then out on the floor of the study
hall. Instantly it was like bedlam let loose.</p>

<p>The girls, who couldn’t see what wild animal was
in their midst, imagined the worst, and scrambled
up on their desks holding their skirts tight about
them.</p>

<p>I laugh every time I think of the comical sight
they made, and just at that moment the door opened
and in came our principal, Mrs. Martin, and with
her were the Reverend John Thornton and a very
wealthy lady who was visiting our school, we heard
afterwards, to see whether or not it was a proper
place to send her niece who is related to nobility
or some such.</p>

<p>Well, I wish you could have seen the expression
on the face of dear Mrs. Martin when she beheld
so many of the girls standing on their desks looking
everywhere about as though they expected to
see at least a huge rat.</p>

<p>“The Marchioness,” as we afterwards dubbed
her, stared through her lorgnette in amazed horror,
but the Reverend John proved that he was really
human for there was a twinkle in his eye when he
spied the frog and picking it up, he dropped it
out of an open window into the garden below.</p>

<p>Of course, as you know, the young ladies of Vine
Haven are well trained in manners, and so, a second
later, we were all lined up on the floor making
properly graceful courtesies, but afterwards we were
told that “The Marchioness” decided not to send her
niece to our school as she did not wish to have her
drilled in “acrobatics.” She evidently supposed that
we were all doing our daily exercises in some outlandish
American fashion. The young lady, we
heard later, was sent to a convent in Paris. My,
but we’re glad she didn’t come here if she is anything
like her aunt.</p>

<p>But all this time none of us knew what Betsy
Clossen was doing to save the romance of poor Miss
Piquilin.</p>

<p>When we went to our algebra class we of “The
Lucky Thirteen” held our heads high and looked
daggers at “The Exclusive Three,” who were whispering
every time Miss Piquilin wrote on the board.</p>

<p>I glanced often at Betsy and I realized that her
mind was not on algebra. Evidently she had not
discovered what the enemy planned doing, but I had
never known Betsy to fail in anything she undertook,
and so I was sure that in due time she would
unearth the desired information if it could be obtained
in an honorable manner.</p>

<p>Nor was I wrong as we soon found out.</p>

<p>Becky Hensley was the only member of “The Exclusive
Three” who did not appear happy. She
seemed to have something on her mind that was
making her miserable. Every little while she stared
into space and when Miss Piquilin spoke to her
directly, she seemed to come back to the school room
with a start. We just knew that the other two had
used Becky as a cat’s paw for their scheme, whatever
it was.</p>

<p>Becky is really a nice girl, but she is easily led.
Well, she failed completely on the test that morning,
and Miss Piquilin, truly out of patience, and
rightly so, commanded her to remain in that class
room until she could hand in a perfect paper.</p>

<p>The poor girl was sobbing when the other pupils
filed out and I was sure that in her upset state of
mind, the child wouldn’t be able to solve the simplest
kind of a problem if she stayed in the class room all
night.</p>

<p>Betsy Clossen, who was monitor that day, stayed
to put things away and she told us afterwards that
as soon as they were alone, Miss Piquilin looked
very sorrowfully at the bent head of the sobbing
girl. Then going to her, she said kindly, “Becky,
don’t you understand at all what I have been trying
to teach you? Tell me! Don’t be afraid. Perhaps
I have not been as patient as I should have been.
It all seems so simple to me, now, perhaps I forget
that once it was difficult.”</p>

<p>Becky looked up, seemingly surprised, and yet
touched by the kind tone. “No, Miss Piquilin,” she
replied, “I really don’t understand algebra at all.</p>

<p>“I was absent during the first part of the term,
when—when mother died, and I guess I missed so
much that I just can’t catch up.”</p>

<p>“Dear girl!” Miss Piquilin said tenderly, “Forgive
me if I have been harsh. If you wish, I will
stay during my rest period for half an hour and
review what you have missed.”</p>

<p>Becky’s eyes glowed her gratitude. “Oh, Miss
Piquilin, how kind you are!” she said. “Dad is so
proud of me and I want to do well for his sake.
I’m all he has, now.”</p>

<p>“And so he shall be proud of you,” Miss Piquilin
declared. “Now dry your eyes, dear, and run out
and play.”</p>

<p>When our teacher was gone, Becky sat staring
out of the window with such an unhappy expression;
then, all of a sudden she put her head down on her
arms and sobbed harder than before.</p>

<p>Betsy went over to her and said, “Dearie, don’t
cry now! Didn’t Miss Piquilin excuse you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes,” the girl sobbed, “but, Oh Betsy, I
wish I hadn’t done it, especially now that she has
been so kind. When I thought she was a mean,
horrid old thing, it wasn’t so hard to do. Oh dear!
Oh dear!”</p>

<p>Then, all of her own free will, Becky told what
she had done that she so deeply regretted. We
were all horrified when Betsy told us half an hour
later.</p>

<p>“We had a meeting of ‘The Lucky Thirteen’ in
my room to try to decide what was best to do
and Becky Hensley was with us. You simply never
could guess the April Fool’s trick that Rose Hedge
of ‘The Exclusive Three’ had planned, and so I
will have to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Becky Hensley, you don’t mean to tell us that
Rose Hedge actually wrote a letter to Professor
Pixley and signed Miss Piquilin’s name to it?”</p>

<p>Becky nodded. “I feel like a traitor telling you
girls. Rose and Hattie will hate me and they’ll
make my life so miserable I’ll just have to leave
school.”</p>

<p>Betsy Clossen slipped an arm about the younger
girl. “Dear,” she said, “your conscience would
make you more miserable if you did not try to right
the wrong you have done in the lives of these two
good people, and, as for Rose and Hattie, I do
not like to speak unkindly of anyone, but do you
think they are the girls your mother would want
you to choose for your best friends?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed not,” Becky declared “and I do so
want to get the letter back if I can.” Then she
looked eagerly at Betsy, as she asked, “Do you suppose
that we could get it before it is delivered? I
slipped out and put it in the street mail box before
the nine-ten collection.”</p>

<p>“Then it has been delivered by this time,” Betsy
replied. “What was in the letter?”</p>

<p>“Rose wrote it,” Becky said, “and she wouldn’t
let me read it all, but this was the beginning, ‘Dear
Professor Pixley, thank you for asking me to marry
you. I will be glad to do so next June,’ and then
it was signed ‘from your loving Beatrice.’ Rose
copied Miss Piquilin’s signature from a letter she
found in the waste basket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dreadful!” we all said with horrified
glances one at another.</p>

<p>“Miss Piquilin will be mortified when she finds
out and of course it will completely shatter their romance.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Betsy sprang up as she exclaimed,
“Girls, it is moonlight, I suggest that three of us cut
through the woods, go down to the Chocolate Shop
and telephone to Professor Pixley and tell him that
the letter he received was just an April Fool joke,
and beg him never to tell our dear Miss Piquilin a
word about it. I am sure he’ll understand because
he has such twinkling eyes.”</p>

<p>Of course Betsy and Becky were two of the three
to go, and Betsy chose me for the third. She and I
have been chums, Megsy, since you left. Well, it was
8 o’clock and we knew we would have to hurry if
we were to be back and in our beds before 9 o’clock,
lights out, bell rang and so away we skipped.</p>

<p>It was dark in the woods but through the trees
we could see the little creek gleaming in the moonlight.
It was so pretty down there in the spring
when the water is high.</p>

<p>Suddenly Betsy clutched my arm and pointed.
Just ahead of us was a white object that looked for
all the world like a ghost. Unfortunately for us,
Becky screamed. A dark object appeared at the
side of the ghost and they hurried toward us. It
was our Miss Piquilin and Professor Pixley.
Scared as we were, we could see that both looked
radiantly happy.</p>

<p>“Girls!” Miss Piquilin exclaimed with an attempt
at severity, “What does this mean? Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Don’t scold them, Beatrice,” the young professor
intervened, “They probably came to see the moonlight
on the water just as we did.” Then he added,
“Young ladies, you will have to look for another
algebra teacher next term for your Miss Piquilin
and I are to be married in June.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh—I am so glad!” Becky gasped, then
seizing us each by the hand she fled back to the
school with Betsy and me in tow.</p>

<p>We never knew what happened, but it didn’t matter,
for surely all is well that ends well. The very
next day Alice Barker went home for the rest of
the year, and so Becky Hensley was admitted to
membership in “The Lucky 13,” and wasn’t she the
happiest girl?</p>

<p class='mb10'>Goodbye, dear cow-girls! You’ll see me in two
months and one week. Lovingly, your <span class='sc'>Babs</span>.</p>


<p>“Wasn’t that an interesting letter?” Virg said.
“Good! Here comes Malcolm. Now we can tell him
about Tom Wentworth.”</p>

<h2 title='A SUDDEN REALIZATION' id='chXXXVIII'>
CHAPTER XXXVIII—A SUDDEN REALIZATION.
</h2>

<p>When Malcolm entered the ranch living-room,
his sister Virginia told him of the newspaper article
which they had discovered. “That’s great news!” he
exclaimed, “We must convey it to the one most interested
as soon as we can. Let me see. This is
Tuesday. Perhaps by day after tomorrow I can
arrange things here so that I can ride into Douglas.
There I can telephone to the postoffice at Red Riverton
and possibly get in touch with some one from
the Wilson ranch.”</p>

<p>“Oh brother! Two whole days! I could send a
letter in less time than that,” Virginia protested.</p>

<p>“But, of what use would a letter be if it were left
lying in the postoffice for no one knows how long?”
Margaret remarked. “Tom wrote, you remember,
that their mail is not often called for.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” Virginia agreed as she returned
to her sewing, “but I am so impatient to have Tom
learn this glorious news.”</p>

<p>“But Sis, why are you so sure that the article refers
to our Tom?” Malcolm asked as he glanced
from the paper which he had been reading.</p>

<p>“True, it does describe him and yet this same
description would fit a dozen other fair young men.
There is nothing unusual about it, and we have no
reason to think that his last name is Wentworth,
have we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Virg, we never told Malcolm about that letter,
did we?” Margaret exclaimed, and then, turning
to the curious lad, she explained about the
scratched out name, the first initial of which had
been faintly visible.</p>

<p>“That does seem like almost conclusive evidence,”
Malcolm declared. “Well, I sincerely hope that you
are right,” he added, “for I liked Tom’s frank,
pleasant face the moment I saw him on Second Peak
with you girls and even after he had declared that
he was an outlaw. I still liked and trusted him.”</p>

<p>“Brother,” Virg said a few moments later as she
dropped her sewing in her lap and looked up, “if
Tom wishes to do so, may he return here and live
with us? Before he left he told us that his week
at V. M. had been the happiest bit of home life that
he had had since his own mother died.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course he may return if he wishes,”
Malcolm said in his hearty way. “I need someone
to remain on the ranch when I am gone. Slim and
Lucky are splendid fellows, but they do not care
to assume the entire responsibility during my absence.
Tom has had greater advantages, and,
though he may not know as much about cattle, he is
intelligent enough to learn in short order.”</p>

<p>Then glancing at the clock, Malcolm added, “The
hour is nine and if I am to do two days’ work in
one tomorrow that I may be free the next, I must
hie me to my slumbers.”</p>

<p>The lad bade them goodnight and started to leave
the room, but he turned at the door and said, “The
mountain road is in bad condition, otherwise I would
ask you young ladies to accompany me to Douglas
on Tuesday, but I fear it would not be safe for our
Rollabout, and it is too far for Margaret to ride.”</p>

<p>That maiden looked up eagerly. “Oh Malcolm,
I do wish you would let me try riding Star into
Douglas. If Virg can, surely I can also.”</p>

<p>“Good!” the lad declared, “I shall indeed be glad
to have your company.”</p>

<p>The girls visited for half an hour longer, and
then they too retired. Virginia felt strangely eager
and excited.</p>

<p>The next day the two girls gave the ranch house
a thorough cleaning. “Time goes much faster if
one keeps every minute of it occupied,” Virginia had
declared, “and the spring cleaning is due, so let’s go
at it.”</p>

<p>When Malcolm and Lucky came in for the noon
repast, they laughed to see the two young housekeepers
in all-over gingham aprons with pretty dust-caps
on their heads, wielding broom and brush in so
vigorous a manner.</p>

<p>“You boys will have to lunch alone today,” Margaret
told them, “for we girls must finish sweeping
the living-room and then while we dine, the dust
will be settling.”</p>

<p>The boys pretended to be greatly disappointed,
but that night at dinner Virg and Margaret made
up for their seeming neglect. They dressed in their
prettiest house gowns and laughed and chattered,
making the meal a merry one.</p>

<p>“How everything shines!” Malcolm declared as
he looked at the glistening glass and silver. “You
aren’t expecting company, are you, Sis?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Virginia replied. “You know
we always go over the house this way every spring
and fall and many times in between.”</p>

<p>Later in the evening when the cow-boy had gone
to the bunkhouse and the three young people sat
about the library table, the girls sewing, and Malcolm
reading a cattleman’s magazine, Virg suddenly
exclaimed, “Just think Megsy, tomorrow Tom is to
know the wonderful news. How I wish that he
might be able to leave the sheep ranch right away
and come back to us. I do hope that he has not
entered into an agreement of any sort promising to
remain with Mr. Wilson for a definite length of
time.”</p>

<p>The girl, happening to glance up just then, found
the kind, gray eyes of her brother earnestly regarding
her. “Do you care so much about Tom’s coming,
Virginia?” Malcolm asked. Then fearing that
his question would be an embarrassing one for his
sister to answer (for he had noted the sudden rose
in her cheeks) he hurriedly added, “I, too, will be
glad to see Tom. I believe he will be free
to come whenever he wishes.”</p>

<p>After that Malcolm seemed to read on, apparently
deeply absorbed in the articles in his magazine,
but in reality he did not even see the printed page
for he had suddenly realized that his sister was a
little girl no longer, that indeed she was verging on
young womanhood, and that some day, perhaps soon,
she would care more for someone else than she did
for him; she might even go somewhere else to live
and leave him alone on the V. M. Ranch.</p>

<p>After about half an hour of vain endeavor to
grasp the meaning of the scientific article, Malcolm
closed the magazine and, looking up, caught an
amused twinkle in Margaret’s violet eyes and saw
the dimple that he had always thought the prettiest
thing a girl could possess.</p>

<p>Leaning over Megsy said merrily, “Malcolm,
hand me that magazine! I am going to give you
an oral exam in what you have read. You have
been staring at one page for so long, I think you
must have been memorizing the commas.”</p>

<p>Malcolm laughed and said irrelevantly, “Thank
you for darning my socks, Mistress Megsy. I see
you have one now in your nimble fingers.”</p>

<p>Then, rising, he added, “Nine o’clock, girls, and
I want you to be ready for the saddle by five tomorrow
morning. It’s a long, hard ride to Douglas
and back. Good night.”</p>

<p>The girls soon heard him whistling in another
part of the house.</p>

<p>A sudden glad hope had awakened in Malcolm’s
consciousness. Perhaps, just perhaps, he might not
have to live alone after all.</p>

<h2 title='LONG DISTANCE PHONE MESSAGE' id='chXXXIX'>
CHAPTER XXXIX—LONG DISTANCE PHONE MESSAGE.
</h2>

<p>The sun was just appearing above a range of
misty gray mountains far across the desert on the
eastern horizon when the three young riders reached
the top of the mesa trail and drew rein to watch
while the glory of the dawn flamed the mountain
peaks with rose and gold.</p>

<p>“A wonderful day has come and surely that is
a good omen,” Virginia said. “I feel as excited as
though something very unusual were about to happen.”</p>

<p>Virg was right! Something very unusual and
unexpected was about to happen, but the nature of
the something was very different from that which
they anticipated.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when Douglas was reached
and Malcolm declared that the girls must go at once
to the Inn and rest for several hours before making
the return trip. Virg consented, declaring, however,
that she wished to remain with Malcolm until
she knew the result of his endeavor to get in touch
with the Wilson Ranch, so together the three young
people went to a long distance telephone. Red
Riverton postoffice soon responded and the postmistress
inquired, “Do you say that you wish to
communicate, if possible, with someone from the
Wilson Ranch? Harry Wilson was in here about
half an hour ago. He always hitches his horse in
front of the postoffice. Hold the wire and I will
see if it is still there.”</p>

<p>While Malcolm held the receiver he rapidly told
the girls what the communication had been.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope he hasn’t gone,” Virg said when
Malcolm’s attention was again called. “No, Harry
Wilson hasn’t left town. His horse is still in front.
I will have a small boy stand there and tell Harry to
see me when he returns. Where will he be able to
get in touch with you?”</p>

<p>“Give the telephone number of the Inn,” Virginia
said when her brother turned to her for a suggestion.</p>

<p>This was done and the three young people hurried
across the hall and sat in the queer little parlor to
await a call from Harry.</p>

<p>Several times the phone rang but it was always
for someone else.</p>

<p>At last the lone clerk at the desk went away and
while he was gone the telephone rang imperatively
several times in rapid succession. Malcolm sprang
up and answered it, then he beckoned to the girls.</p>

<p>“It’s for us,” he told them; then to Harry, who
was at the other end of the line, he said, “This is
Malcolm Davis. Surely you remember me, don’t
you?</p>

<p>“I stayed several days at your place two years ago
in September. I thought you’d remember that. We
had great fun that day, didn’t we? Yes, I do plan
coming up north again some time, but today I
called up to ask about our friend Tom. We are
eager to get into communication with him as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>“He isn’t in town with you, is he? What? You
don’t know where he is? Has he left you? How
long has he been gone? Over a week now? And
no trace of him has been found? There hasn’t
been a storm, has there? Hum! That certainly is
serious. You are sending out a searching party?
When do they leave? I’ll try to get there. Yes, indeed.
I’ll start for your place as soon as I possibly
can. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>“Malcolm, what is it? What has happened to
Tom?” Virg asked her face suddenly paled with
anxiety.</p>

<p>The lad led the girls back to the stiff little parlor.</p>

<p>“Tom hasn’t deserted them, has he?” Virginia
asked eagerly. “Oh, brother, I am so sure he hasn’t
proved untrustworthy.”</p>

<p>Malcolm shook his head. “Not that,” he said dismally.
“I wish he had deserted of his own free will.
Anything would be better than that which has happened.
I’m terribly sorry now that I brought you
girls with me into town, but, of course, you must
know the truth. Instead of being untrustworthy,
Tom may have risked his life to prove his worthiness
of a trust. Harry says that his father had
five hundred very valuable Merinos coming by rail
and they wanted to send their best man to meet
them and drive the sheep in from the station, so
they selected Tom, and as there was need of two
drivers for so large a flock, little Francisco Quintano
Mendoza accompanied him. Harry expected that
about three days would be required to drive the
flock through the mountain pass, stopping to graze
and rest in the grassy valleys, but four and then
five days passed and Tom did not return.</p>

<p>“Harry had not accompanied them because his
father was away at the time and his mother alone
on the ranch, but, at last he became so anxious
that his mother urged him to ride to Red Riverton.
There he found that the Merinos had arrived safely
the week before and that Tom and the small Mexican
boy had driven them away about noon on the
day of their arrival, and that they had taken the
beaten track toward the mountains where they had
been lost to sight when they entered the Red Rock
Pass.</p>

<p>“Harry then visited the sheriff and together with
several men, they rode to the pass, but although
they could see many hoof-prints in the soft mud
where a spring kept the ground ever moist, they
could not trace them on the desert where the winds
often changed the surface of the sand.</p>

<p>“The sheriff and his men seemed to believe that
Tom has turned rustler and that he had spirited
away the valuable Merinos for his own gain, but
to this suggestion Harry would not listen. He knew
Tom to be absolutely trustworthy, he declared, but
since he had no better theory to offer, the men left
him still unconvinced.</p>

<p>“The father has now returned and at his suggestion
a large party of men are to start on a wide
circling round-up of the entire sheep raising section
of the state, hoping in that way to come upon
some evidence that may at least solve the mystery
if it does not enable them to recover the lost sheep.
They need more assistance, Harry tells me, and so
I promised to go to him as soon as I possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh dear!” Virg exclaimed, unshed
tears in her eyes, “I shall never forgive myself
for having sent Tom north if harm has befallen
him.”</p>

<p>“My theory,” Malcolm continued, “is that a band
of thieves, rustlers, knew that the very valuable shipment
of Merinos was due, and that they were lying
in wait in the pass for Tom and in some manner
they have spirited away both the flock and the drivers.
I believe that this will be proved true when we
round up that entire section.”</p>

<p>Then looking at Virginia anxiously, he added, “I
ought to go north from here, as I can follow the
state road and reach Red Riverton at least half a
day sooner than I could from home but I do not like
to leave you girls unprotected. I wish—”</p>

<p>He stopped speaking and stared at someone who
had just entered the Inn. Then excusing himself,
he hurried out.</p>

<p>The persons whom Malcolm had seen were no
other than his good neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Dartley.
They were surprised to see the young man and note
his very evident excitement. Hurriedly Malcolm
explained the situation. “Of course we will look
after the girls,” the kindly Mrs. Dartley declared,
then, going into the prim little parlor, she held out
both plump, freckled hands as she said sympathetically,
“You poor dears! I just know how worried
you are about your friend Tom, but you’ll feel better,
I’m sure, to have Malcolm help in the search.
My husband and I drove in with the buggy. We’ll
be going back about 3 o’clock, and you can ride
along with us as far as the sand hills. You won’t
mind going the rest of the way to V. M . alone, I
know, because you ride it so often.”</p>

<p>The girls assured Mrs. Dartley that they would
be in their saddles at the hour of 3 and that good
woman then bustled away to do the shopping that
had brought her into town.</p>

<p>Malcolm returned and took his sister’s hand.
“Virginia,” he said earnestly, “don’t grieve yet, I
honestly believe that we are going to find Tom
somewhere, unharmed and being worthy of the trust
that was placed in him.”</p>

<p>After dining together at the Inn, Malcolm departed.
When he was gone, the girls wandered out
to look about the stores and make a few purchases
and pass away the time until 3.</p>

<p>That hour at last arrived and Virginia and Margaret
were waiting in their saddles, when the Dartley
equipage appeared from the stables. The girls
were not very talkative and the kind woman,
realizing that they were greatly worried about their
friend whom she herself knew little, did not expect
them to talk and the long journey was made almost
in absolute silence.</p>

<p>When the sand hills were reached, it was growing dusk.
“My, but you two girls must be all tired
out,” Mrs. Dartley said as her husband drew rein.
“You’ve been in the saddle most all day, being as
you left home before sunrise, but Uncle Tex will
have a good supper waiting for you and then you
get right into bed. Young folks like you two rest
up easy and tomorrow you’ll be as bright as ever.
Telephone to me, Virgie, if you need anything or
hear any news.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will Mrs. Dartley, and thank you for escorting
us this far. Goodnight! Goodnight!”</p>

<p>Then the girls started down the trail toward V.
M. through the gathering dusk. “How I do hope
it will be a good night for our Tom,” Virginia said,
“wherever he is.” Then, as they dismounted at the
home corral, she added, “Oh, if only I were a man
so that I might join in the search.”</p>

<p>Virginia little dreamed of the very important part
she was to play even though she were only a girl.</p>

<h2 title='A SURPRISING TELEGRAM' id='chXL'>
CHAPTER XL—A SURPRISING TELEGRAM.
</h2>

<p>The next day the girls were restless; troubled by
the uncertainty of it all, and anxiously waiting for
news, although they had no way of hearing directly
from Red Riverton. However, Malcolm had promised
that he would telegraph Mr. Wells at the Junction
if there were any definite news, then he could
ride over and deliver it to the girls.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex, when told all that had happened, shook
his head dismally. “Ah reckon as how Malcolm is
right,” he drawled, “Rustlers ’twas as took the
herd, like’s not, and if so, they’ve hushed up the
drivers someway.” Then noting the white face of
the girl he so loved, he hastened to add, self-reproachingly,
“Thar! Thar! Miss Virginia dearie, ah
ought not to skeer yo’ all that-a-way. Like’s not yo’
friend Tom is safe somewhar. Ah feels in ma bones
as we’ll heah news somehow today.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” Margaret declared, “and honestly,
Virg, I believe that it will be good news.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled wanly, and then, springing up she
exclaimed, “Let’s ride over to The Junction,
Megsy, and see if there is any mail for us. That
will help to pass the time away.”</p>

<p>They were soon in the saddle, but, before they
had left the dooryard, Margaret pointed up toward
the mesa trail. “Someone is coming at top-speed,”
she called over her shoulder. They drew rein and
watched the rapidly approaching cloud of sand in
the midst of which they soon saw a small horse and
a boy rider.</p>

<p>“It’s Wells,” Virginia cried excitedly, urging forward
to meet the newcomer. “I do believe that he
has a telegram for us.”</p>

<p>“He certainly has,” Megsy agreed, as she rode
alongside. “See! He is waving a yellow envelope.
I am sure it is good news or Malcolm would not
have wired it.”</p>

<p>But a surprise awaited the girls. It was a telegram,
to be sure, that the boy gave to Virginia, but
it was not about Tom nor from Malcolm.</p>

<p>“Margaret Selover!” Virginia exclaimed, her
eyes wide with surprise when she had read the message.
“Who do you suppose this telegram is from?”</p>

<p>“Babs?” was the eager inquiry.</p>

<p>“Yes, Babs. The school has been closed because
of an epidemic and her father is bringing her West
at once. In fact, she will arrive at The Junction
this afternoon at 2.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the most wonderful news?” Margaret
cried. “Oh Virg! I can hardly believe it possible
that I am to see my beloved roommate this very
day.”</p>

<p>“It is hard to believe but it must be true,” her
friend laughingly replied; then she called to the little
boy who was starting away on his Pinto. “Wait,
I am going to give you something.”</p>

<p>The something was a big shiny silver dollar. The
boy’s eyes were almost as big and bright when he
clasped it in his small grimy hand. “Is it all fo’
me Miss Virginia?” he asked, and, when assured
that it was he ejaculated, “Gee Whilikers!” Then,
quite forgetting his manners, he started the pony
on a mad race for home but whirled around to shout,
“Thank you, Miss Virginia!” from up on the mesa
trail.</p>

<p>“If I only knew that all is well at the Wilson
Ranch,” Virginia said, “I would be so happy about
Barbara’s coming. Of course I am glad, as it is,
to have her visit us, but it does seem as though I
can’t be really merry again until I know what has
happened to Tom.”</p>

<p>“I understand just how you feel, dear,” Margaret
replied as the two girls, having returned their
horses to the corral, started walking arm in arm toward
the house.</p>

<p>At dinner that noon Virginia asked Lucky if he
would drive them to The Junction in their car, which
Malcolm called the “Rollabout,” to meet the 2:10
train. The kindly cow-boy assured them that he
would do so. At 1 o’clock the two girls were in the
big touring car with Lucky at the wheel, and at 2
o’clock were waiting at the Junction for the coming
of the train.</p>

<p>“Maybe some word about Tom will arrive from
Malcolm while we are here,” Virginia said, as she
and Margaret sat on the bench in front of the long,
low building which was station, postoffice, general
store and home of the Wells family.</p>

<p>There were no other buildings in sight, only
desert and mountains with here and there, near the
creek bed, a clump of cottonwood trees where a
silver thread of water trickled from the rocks.</p>

<p>Suddenly Virginia sprang up and listened to the
clicking of the instrument within. “A telegram,”
she said. “But Mr. Wells isn’t here so how are we
to know what it is?”</p>

<p>“There he is, down the track,” Margaret told
her, and Virginia, running forward, eagerly called,
“Oho, Mr. Wells, isn’t a telegram coming in?”</p>

<p>“Wall, now, like as not,” the good man replied, as
he bustled into the small ticket office. The girls,
with tightly clasped hands, waited breathlessly.
Would it be a message from Malcolm?</p>

<p>At last Mr. Wells peered smilingly at them, over
his glasses. “Tain’t nothin’ unusual,” he said.
“Tain’t nothin’ unusual,” he said. “Train’s late.
That’s all, but it may make up time on the down
grade. It usually does.”</p>

<p>The girls sank back on the hard bench truly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Here comes the train!” little Wells sang out
ten minutes later as he raced toward them. The
roaring noise in the tunnel proved the truth of his
statement even before the long train drawn by two
engines emerged into the sunlight.</p>

<p>The girls ran forward and eagerly scanned each
coach.</p>

<p>“There she is! There’s my Babs!” Megsy sang
out as she saw her friend’s face beaming through
one of the windows. A moment later, when the
train had come to a standstill, Barbara leaped to the
platform, dropped suitcase and umbrella, and gave
Megsy a good, hard, schoolgirl hug. Then she
whirled about and held out both hands to Virginia
as she bubbled, “I’m not going to wait to be introduced
for I know you well and love you right this
very minute.” Then putting an arm about each she
exclaimed happily, “I wonder if you dear cow-girls
have any idea how excited and delighted I am to
be here.”</p>

<p>“We are just as excited, and I do believe even
more delighted,” Margaret declared. “We hardly
know what to say or do.”</p>

<p>“Well, first of all, please, lead me to a cafeteria,”
Babs implored. “A—a which?” Virginia inquired,
truly puzzled, for the western girl had never before
heard of such a place.</p>

<p>How Margaret laughed! “Babs,” she said, “if you
can find one on our desert, we will gladly pay for
whatever you wish to order.”</p>

<p>Barbara looked about, her eyes glowing. “Oh!
Oh!” she exclaimed. “I’m glad—glad that there
isn’t one around. I’ve been just longing to get away
from civilization, and so, the wilder it is out here,
the better I shall like it.” They were starting toward
the car, when kind Mrs. Wells hailed them
from her kitchen door. “Virgie!” she called,
“wouldn’t you girls like a few of my sugar cookies?
They’re just fresh from the bakin’.”</p>

<p>“Do my ears hear right?” Babs said dramatically,
in a low undertone, while Virginia was gladly accepting
the proffered treat. “Barbara,” the western
girl called, “you and Megsy come here. I want
Mrs. Wells to meet the newest addition to the V. M.
family and if we like, we may each have a glass of
buttermilk.”</p>

<p>“Wall, now, Miss Barbara, you’ve come to stay
on the desert for a spell, hev yo’?” the motherly woman
asked as she smiled down at the petite Babs.
Then she added, “Yo’ aren’t much bigger than a
pint o’ honey, and I can easy tell by your sunny face
that you’re most as sweet.”</p>

<p>Virginia took two of her sugar cookies over to
the waiting Lucky who had spent most of the hour
discussing desert topics with Mr. Wells.</p>

<p>Babs gazed at the lean, sinewy, sun-browned cow-boy
with unconcealed interest, and when she was
introduced, she extended her small gloved hand saying
eagerly, “Oh, Mr. Lucky, you do look like Bill
Hart, don’t you? He’s the cow-boy I’m best acquainted
with, but he always has a gun sticking out
of his hip pocket or somewhere. I don’t suppose
that you carry a gun, do you?”</p>

<p>The cow-boy replied, with his good-natured
drawl, that he usually “packed” along a couple or so,
and to prove this statement, he produced two small
guns. After a whispered hint from the fun-loving
Margaret, Lucky threw an empty bottle high in
the air and then, firing three times in rapid succession,
he shattered the bottle, much to the delight
of the newly arrived easterner.</p>

<p>Later, when Babs and Margaret were on the back
seat of the “Rollabout” the former confided in a
low voice, “I’m so glad to find that cow-boys are
really like moving pictures. The girls in school said
they knew I was going to be disappointed, but I’m
not! Everything is just as I had expected, only
heaps more so!”</p>

<p>Megsy reached out and took her friend’s hand.
“You’ll love it here, Babsie,” she said, “and, too, you
will love Virginia and Malcolm.</p>

<p>“I care for my guardian now just as though he
were my own brother,” she added, trying to convince
herself that her words were true. Then she
leaned back, wondering where her guardian might
be at that moment. Babs, too, was glad to be quiet
that she might look about at the desert and mountains
and rejoice that at last she was in the land
of which she had so long dreamed.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex was waiting on the porch of the ranch
house, and, if Babs wished to see a character who
would have rejoiced the heart of a moving picture
director, she surely did in the old man who had
been a cow-boy since those early days when the
desert teemed with exciting adventure.</p>

<p>“Miss Virginia, dearie,” he drawled, when he had
carried in the luggage, “that thar Injun boy was
here twict while yo’ all’s been gone.”</p>

<p>Babs was eagerly listening. “Oh, was that little
Red Feather, Megsy, that you wrote me about?
I’m just wild to see him.”</p>

<p>Virginia assented. “I wonder what he wanted,”
she said, then, as a sudden thought came to her,
she caught Margaret’s hand as she exclaimed,
“Megsy, if Tom manages to escape from the
rustlers, I do believe that he would go to the Indian
village to hide. A stranger never could find the entrance
in the wall of rocks unless he just happened to
stumble upon it.”</p>

<p>“I do hope you are right,” Margaret replied. “I
hope our Tom is safe with the Papagoes.”</p>

<p>“Girls,” the mystified Barbara exclaimed, “who
are you talking about? Has anything happened to
the outlaw Tom about whom you wrote me?”
Virginia, remembering that she was hostess, and
that her anxiety must not occupy her thought to
the exclusion of the comfort of the newly arrived
guest, then exclaimed, “Margaret will tell you all
about it while you unpack. I am sure you will want
to wash and rest a while before supper. You two
are to room together just as you did at school.
Meanwhile, I will hie me to the kitchen and assist
Uncle Tex in preparing an early repast, for I am
sure that you are still hungry after so long a journey.”</p>

<p>When the two eastern friends had entered Margaret’s
pleasant room Virginia did not go at once
to the kitchen. Instead she took her brother’s
powerful glasses and looked long up the mesa trail,
hoping to see the little Indian boy reappearing, but
he did not come. At last, with a sigh, she turned
toward the kitchen and her heart was heavy. “I
wonder what message Winona has for me,” she
thought. “It must be important or she would not
have sent twice.”</p>

<h2 title='A HOPE RENEWED' id='chXLI'>
CHAPTER XLI—A HOPE RENEWED.
</h2>

<p>That evening as the three girls sat in front of
the wide hearth on which a mesquite root was cheerily
burning, they talked quietly together of all that
had happened.</p>

<p>“Have you heard lately from your brother, Peyton?”
Margaret asked.</p>

<p>Babs shook her head and there were sudden tears
in her pretty blue eyes as she replied, “Oh, girls,
I try to forget my great disappointment, but of
course I must tell you about it. The cards that
were sent to me from China, bearing only the
initials P. W., were not from my darling brother
after all. I had actually forgotten that I had an
acquaintance with those same initials. Who do you
suppose Megsy, that the cards were from?”</p>

<p>“Patty Warren, perhaps,” Margaret surmised.
“Long ago I thought of her, merely because of the
initials, but I supposed that she was still in school
with you. Had she gone to China?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” Barbara replied. “I did know
that Patty had left school because her widowed
mother had married a minister to some outlandish
foreign country, but, though the child was very fond
of me, I never thought much about her, partly, because
she was younger, and also, because I had you
and Betsy Clossen for pals and two intimate friends
are as many as I care for, but last week I had a
letter from her postmarked London asking me if I
had received the truly lovely Chinese kimona that
she had sent for my birthday and giving me for the
first time, a return address. Of course, I wrote her
at once to express my appreciation, but I was heart
broken. I cried for hours and hours that night, for
I had been so sure that my dear lost brother was
keeping in touch with me and somehow, even that
little had been a comfort to me. Now, I am convinced
that Peyton must be dead. He was so loving
and tender-hearted even when he was a little fellow;
he wouldn’t let month after month pass if he were
alive without assuring me that he still cares for
me and that all is well with him.”</p>

<p>“Poor Babs,” Virg said as she reached out, with
real sympathy, and placed a comforting hand over
the petite one of their friend. “I know how my
heart would ache if Malcolm were lost, but don’t
give up hope, dear. Such strange things happen in
this world.”</p>

<p>“I am going to keep on hoping,” Barbara assured
them. Then she added, “I have no way of
knowing, of course, but I do believe that the object
of my father’s visit to the West is to try to find
Peyton. You see, when the epidemic broke out in
school, we packed and left that very day, all of us
who had not been exposed, and when I reached home
father was not expecting me. I quietly entered the
house and stood in the open library door. There he
was, pacing up and down, an expression of grave
anxiety on his face. I knew at once that he was
greatly troubled about something, and for the first
time since mother died there was a rush of tenderness
in my heart for him. He looked so gray and
sad and so all alone.</p>

<p>“Father!” I cried as I ran to him. He didn’t
seem surprised, someway; he just reached out his
arms and held me close.</p>

<p>“‘Little daughter,’ he said, ‘I needed you and you
came to me; just as your mother came once, when I
needed her—but—she couldn’t stay. If only that
other Barbara had lived, all this would not have
happened.’”</p>

<p>Then he bent his head down against mine and
a hot tear fell on my cheek.</p>

<p>“‘Daddy,’ I said; I hadn’t called him that since
I was very little. ‘Daddy, have you been so lonely?
why didn’t you send for me sooner?’</p>

<p>“His reply was, ‘I am going West on a very important
mission tomorrow, little daughter, so don’t
unpack your trunk. I’ll take you with me and you
may visit your friends in Arizona.’</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell me what his mission was, but I do
know that he bought a ticket for some small town
in Texas. He said that he would communicate with
me in about a week. Oh, girls,” Babs added with a
sob in her voice, “I wish I’d been more loving to
my father. I ought to have known that his seeming
sternness covered a most lonely heart with
mother gone, and his only son wayward, or so daddy
supposed.”</p>

<p>Margaret was thinking rapidly. “A town in
Texas. Tom had been wrongly accused somewhere
down there. Could Tom be Peyton after all and
had the father received some word that had led him
to believe that he would find his boy?”</p>

<p>“Bedtime, girls,” Virginia said as she arose. “We
may need unusual strength tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Megsy sought an early opportunity to be alone
with Virginia the next morning and ask her if she
thought it possible that Tom might be the missing
Peyton, and that the father having received some
inkling of the boy’s whereabouts, had come West to
search for him.</p>

<p>Virginia looked up eagerly. “I hadn’t thought of
it, Megsy,” she said, “but now that you suggest it,
I do believe that it might be possible. For myself
I do not care who Tom may be, all that I want to
know is that he is safe and well somewhere, anywhere.
Uncle Tex doesn’t tell us what he really
thinks, but I know. I have often heard the cow-boys
relate tales of rustlers who came upon a lonely
herder, and if they wish to spirit away the sheep,
they silence the only man who could witness against
them.” Then she added, “Babs is calling, dear. We
would better not tell her that we think Tom may be
her lost brother, Peyton, for how cruel would be
the disappointment were we wrong.”</p>

<p>The morning hours dragged slowly to the girls
who were eagerly awaiting the hoped-for reappearance
of little Red Feather. “I am sure Winona will
send him back,” Virg said many, many times, but
he did not come.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lucky had ridden to the Junction
to get any mail that might have come on the
early morning train, and about noon he returned
with several letters for each of the girls. Virg, with
an exclamation of eagerness, tore open an envelope
addressed in her brother’s familiar handwriting.</p>


<p class='mt10 '>“Dear little sister,” she read aloud.</p>

<p>“I know just how eagerly you are awaiting a
message from me, but I have been unable to communicate
with you before. When I reached the
sheep ranch, Mr. Wilson asked me to ride with several
Mexicans whom he trusted, up toward the Lost
Canyon which is in the roughest and wildest part of
the mountains to the north. It is seldom visited by
herders as there is practically no vegetation there.
However, Lopez Andero, one of the herders who
has long been in Mr. Wilson’s employ, stated that
after a spring of heavy rains there was, in an almost
inaccessible valley in the heart of the mountains,
enough grass to last a herd of 500 Merinos
for several weeks and that there could not a better
place for rustlers to hide the flock. It was twilight
when we started, Lopez in the lead. After a
long, wearisome ride we reached the entrance to the
canyon an hour before daybreak.</p>

<p>“We wished to approach the valley under cover of
the darkness so that we might come upon the rustlers
without their knowledge, if indeed, they were there,
but when at last we reached the summit overlooking
the valley, to our great disappointment, in the grey
light of the dawning day we saw only a lonely,
bowl-shaped hollow, in which, as Lopez had said,
grass was luxuriantly growing.</p>

<p>“We then rode back to the home ranch and found
several other parties who had also returned with the
same discouraging report. No trace of sheep or
shepherds had been found.</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are greatly depressed, as
indeed, are we all. The loss of the sheep, Mr. Wilson
assures me, means little to him; he is so eager to
find Tom. I am sorry, sister, that I have to write
this news, knowing that it will sadden you and
Margaret. I had hoped that today I would be able
to return to V. M. accompanied by Tom and
give you a real surprise, but now I do not expect
to be able to do that, at least not soon. Send me a
line to Red Riverton today if you can conveniently.</p>

<div class='tar' style='margin-right:6em;'>“Your brother,</div>
<div class='sc mb10 tar' style='margin-right:4em;'>Malcolm.”</div>

<p>“Margaret,” Virginia said when she had finished
reading the letter, “I am going to ride to the Papago
village today. Will you and Babs accompany me?”</p>

<h2 title='AN INDIAN VILLAGE' id='chXLII'>
CHAPTER XLII—AN INDIAN VILLAGE.
</h2>

<p>When Virginia calmly announced that she was
going to ride to the Papago village, Margaret exclaimed
in surprise: “But, Virg, dear, it’s mid-day
now and you have said that it is a long, hard ride.
Would there be time for us to go and return all
in one afternoon?”</p>

<p>The western girl shook her head. “I thought we
might remain there over night,” was her unexpected
reply, “and come back tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>Bab’s eyes were big and round.</p>

<p>“Virginia!” she ejaculated. “You don’t mean
that you would actually stay all night in an Indian
village? Why, I wouldn’t be able to sleep the least
little bit, I am sure of that. All the time I would
be listening, expecting to hear moccasined feet
steathily creeping toward my bedeside, and—”</p>

<p>Virginia’s laughter interrupted the speaker.</p>

<p>“Babsy dear, remember that this is the year 1922,”
she reminded, “and the Indians whom we are to
visit are just as friendly as one could wish neighbors
to be. Forty years ago, it is true, we would not
have cared to remain all night with the red men of
the desert, but, after all, they were unfriendly merely
because they believed the white man to be
treacherous, and were they not right? The pale
face came and drove them from their happy hunting
grounds with his superior cunning and the force
of arms. My sympathy has always been largely
with the Indians, but come, let’s have an early lunch
that we may soon be on our northward way.”</p>

<p>“Ohee, I’m so excited,” the petite Babs exclaimed,
skipping gaily along between her two friends as
they returned to the ranch house. “I never knew a
moving picture story that was more thrilling than
the one that we are living this very minute.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled down into the pretty, shining, upturned
face of the younger girl and she thought she
had never seen any more charming. Barbara’s fresh
young joy in everything was a delight to the other
girls, for even Margaret had become so used to cow-boys,
Indians and adventure that the first thrill of
it all had somewhat subsided, although as she often
declared, she would never cease to love the desert.</p>

<p>When Uncle Tex heard of the planned visit to
the Papago village he shook his head, saying he
“reckoned” as Malcolm wouldn’t like them to ride
so far alone, but the matter was settled to the old
man’s complete satisfaction when Lucky announced
that he would be riding north to the Dartley Ranch
in about an hour and that he would accompany the
girls until they reached the wall of rock surrounding
the Papago village.</p>

<p>The great old grandfather clock was striking the
hour of one when Lucky brought up from the corral
three saddled ponies. Dixie had been chosen for
Barbara that morning when she had been taken to
the little fenced-in pasture and introduced to the
small bunch of riding horses.</p>

<p>When Babs emerged from her room dressed for
the first time in her cowgirl khaki outfit, she was
bubbling with glee. “Oh, how I do wish Miss Piquilin
and the girls at school could see me now,”
she exclaimed. “Wouldn’t Betsy Clossen be envious,
though.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were all in the saddle.
“Goodbye, Uncle Tex!” they shouted in merry
chorus and then they turned to follow Lucky who
had already started up the mesa trail.</p>

<p>Margaret noticed that Virginia’s eyes were
troubled even though her lips were smiling at them.</p>

<p>“I wonder what adventure is awaiting us,” Megsy
said aloud. It was well, perhaps, that they did not
know.</p>

<p>For two hours the girls, accompanied by Lucky,
rode over the trail that led to the north. They
had circled about the Dartley Ranch, and though
Virginia had urged him to do so, the cow-boy would
not permit them to go the remainder of the way
alone and unprotected.</p>

<p>“But it’s taking you miles out of your way,
Lucky,” Virginia protested. “You know I have
never been afraid to ride alone, anywhere on all our
wild desert.”</p>

<p>“Ah know, Miss Virginia,” Lucky replied, “but
them times was sort of different like, and what’s
more, I promised Malcolm as how ah’d look out for
you all. A little extra riding won’t hurt me no-how.”</p>

<p>Lucky was obstinate, and Virginia knew that it
was useless for her to protest, but when, at last,
they were within sight of the wall of rock, she drew
rein as she said, “Lucky, surely you will permit us
to ride this last mile alone, for you can see that
there is nothing between here and the mountains to
do us harm.”</p>

<p>To Virginia’s delight the cow-boy acquiesced and
whirling his pony about he galloped away, waving
his sombrero while the girls called after him,
“Goodbye, Lucky, thank you for escorting us.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Indian village, Virg?” Babs inquired
as they neared the mountains. “I can’t see
a tepee anywhere about.”</p>

<p>“Nor will you,” the western girl told her. “My
Indian friends are modern and live in adobe dwellings.”</p>

<p>They rode slowly along the base of the sheer wall
of rocks. “It’s the strangest thing,” Virg declared,
“When I was here last with my brother, I made a
mental note of a peculiar grouping of cactus plants
that grew within a stone’s throw of the almost hidden
entrance, but now I do not see it anywhere.”</p>

<p>Margaret had ridden ahead and she suddenly
whirled about and galloped back toward the others.
She seemed excited about something.</p>

<p>“There’s an Indian in ambush just ahead of us,”
she said as she glanced fearfully back over her shoulder.
“He is crouched down behind a clump of cactus
plants and I’m just sure that he’s been watching
us!”</p>

<p>Barbara’s eyes were wide with terror. “Oh,
Virg,” she exclaimed, “maybe the Papagoes have become
suddenly hostile. Maybe they have gone on
the warpath.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s laugh was natural and fearless. “It’s
probably little Red Feather or one of his comrades,”
she said as she urged Comrade forward, but
the Indian, who rose as they approached, was not
one whom she had ever seen before. However, she
knew from the red mark on his forehead that he
was a Papago, and so she said the few words that
she had learned in their tongue, “Friends—come,
see Winona.”</p>

<p>Silently and solemnly, the young Indian pointed
toward the wall of rock beyond and back of him,
and as they rode in that direction, Virginia soon
saw the opening for which she had been searching.</p>

<p>They entered a narrow canyon, riding single file.
“Girls!” Babs said, almost in a whisper, “I don’t
feel real. I just can’t.” Then she added as she
lifted her head to listen, “Hark! Virginia, what is
that howling noise ahead of us? It sounds like a
pack of wolves. Hadn’t we better go back? Won’t
they tear us to pieces?”</p>

<p>Virginia, until that moment had quite forgotten
the pack of wolf-like Indian dogs that guarded the
inner entrance of the narrow canyon. Perhaps it
would be unwise for them to ride further unless they
were accompanied by someone who could assure the
dogs that they were friends. But at that very moment
the problem was solved for, silhouetted against
the light at the far end of the canyon, there appeared
a slender Indian girl riding on a graceful,
wiry pony.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Virg, “There’s Winona, so
now we may ride forward without fear.”</p>

<p>Babs was so excited at the mere thought of meeting
an Indian girl in an Indian village that the real
object of their visit was somewhat lost to her
thought. What would Winona look like she was
wondering as they rode along single file. How
queer that such a fine girl as Virginia Davis should
have an Indian maiden as an intimate friend, and
yet, it was true for she herself had heard Virg say
how greatly she admired Winona.</p>

<p>A few moments later, when they had reached the
inner entrance to the fertile bowl-like valley, Babs
understood the charm of the Indian girl who so
simply and sincerely had welcomed them to her
home. Later, as Barbara and Margaret were riding
side by side following the other two the impulsive
Babs exclaimed, “Oh, Megsy, isn’t she truly
beautiful? How her dark eyes glow and do see
those thick shiny black braids that hang far below
her waist. I just know that I am going to love
her, too.”</p>

<p>“She is beautiful,” Margaret agreed, “but I think
it is because there is something truly noble about her
face. Virginia has told me that Winona longed to
go away to school but she relinquished her desire
that she might remain here and teach the little Papago
children and help her own people.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what school she would attend. I
suppose the girls in Vine Haven would deem themselves
too good to associate with her.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed gaily. “Too good to associate
with a princess?” she inquired. “For that is what
Winona really is; an Indian princess; the daughter
of Chief Grey Hawk.”</p>

<p>“Is she really?” Bab’s eyes were wide and glowing.
Then she added, as she glanced about at the
small scattered adobe houses over the doors of
which red peppers were festooned to dry in the sun,
“Margaret, where do you suppose we are going to
sleep? In one of those little huts? They look sort
of skeery to me, but maybe that’s because they are
so different from houses with which I am familiar.
I love this place, though. It’s so wild and picturesque;
exactly what one would wish an Indian village
to be. Shouldn’t you think so, Megsy?”</p>

<p>Margaret smiled at her impulsive chattery friend
and nodded, “I’m ever so interested in it too,” she
replied. “See yonder, in the shade of that big
thorny cactus, two Indian women are squatted on
the ground weaving baskets. I wish I might buy
one. I always adored the Indian things Betsy Clossen
had in our room at school”</p>

<p>Then, irrelevantly: “Oh Megsy, do you suppose
that you will ever be my room-mate again back in
dear old Vine Haven?”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell, Babs. It all depends on what
will happen. If I am able to go, then our darling
Virg will go too.”</p>

<p>“Ohee, how wonderful that would be!” the irrepressible
Babs exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Let’s gallop,” Margaret suggested. “Virginia is
beckoning to us.”</p>

<h2 title='THE LOST MESSAGE' id='chXLIII'>
CHAPTER XLIII—THE LOST MESSAGE.
</h2>

<p>The enthusiastic Margaret and the bubbling
Babs galloped to the place where Winona and Virginia,
having drawn rein, were awaiting them.
Virg said:</p>

<p>“Winona has been telling me that she did not really
have a message for us, that is, nothing that could
concern Tom. Red Feather had chanced to capture
a carrier pigeon which in some manner had been
hurt, and had been unable to continue its flight and
deliver the message that had been entrusted to its
care.”</p>

<p>“Winona found a piece of brown paper wound
about the bird’s leg and securely fastened, but she
was unable to read it. It was then that she recalled
having heard me say that brother Malcolm and I
had often sent messages to each other written in our
secret code, and she wondered if the carrier pigeon
might belong to us, and so she sent little Red
Feather with the bit of brown paper. On his return
that night he lost it; he cannot think where, and that
is why Winona did not send him again to V. M.
Brother and I never did possess a carrier pigeon, and
so, of course, the message could not be for me.”</p>

<p>“A pigeon will only carry a message back to its
own home place, isn’t that so, Virginia?” Margaret
inquired.</p>

<p>“I believe that it is,” was the reply. Then turning
to Winona she said: “I would like to see that
bird. May I?”</p>

<p>“Red Feather has it secured somewhere, I think,”
the Indian girl replied. “There he comes now. We
will ask him.”</p>

<p>The little Indian boy with a jaunty red feather in
the narrow band that bound his shiny black hair
close to his head, was racing toward them while a
small wolf-like puppy sprang up at him, barking joyfully.</p>

<p>The girls dismounted and Virginia held out her
right hand; then turning to the interested Babs, she
said: “Barbara, this is Red Feather of whom you
have heard. Perhaps he will shake hands with you
and Margaret.”</p>

<p>The bright, black eyes were lifted inquiringly toward
Winona, and then when she smilingly nodded
at him, the little fellow extended one hand, his usually
solemn little face twinkling merrily as though he
were doing something unusual and amusing. This
was evidently not the Papago manner of greeting.
Babs wondered if they rubbed noses instead.</p>

<p>Winona spoke rapidly in a language strange to
the Easterners and the small boy listened attentively.
Then, as though complying with the Indian
maiden’s request, he led the ponies away to the
fenced-in corral which was in the middle of the
bowl-like valley and was surrounded by the scattered
adobe huts.</p>

<p>“Red Feather will return directly,” Winona told
them, “and then he will show us his pigeon.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, almost before it seemed possible,
the Indian boy was racing back, the puppy barking
at his heels.</p>

<p>Then with the little fellow in the lead, they walked
toward the wall of rock on the north side of the
village. There, in a small, high hole in the cliff,
Red Feather had the pigeon hidden. A strong cord
tied about one leg was securely fastened to a peg
which had been pounded into a nearby crevice.</p>

<p>Crushed corn had been scattered about within the
bird’s reach.</p>

<p>“The wing does not seem broken.” Winona said.
“I think the bird flew against the wall of rock, and
for a time was stunned, do you say?”</p>

<p>She glanced inquiringly at Virginia, who nodded.
“I wish we might find the message,” Virg said.
“If it were in Spanish I could read it.”</p>

<p>“We may find it,” Winona replied, “but come
and I will give you your supper.”</p>

<p>“My father, Chief Grey Hawk, is away hunting
with several of our men,” the Indian girl told them
as they walked back to the village, “and so I am
alone in my home. There is one wide bed and in it
you three shall sleep unless you would rather have
another house by yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” Babs heard herself saying eagerly.
“Please, Winona, let us stay with you.”</p>

<p>The Indian maiden smiled. This pretty, bubbling
girl was so different from anyone whom she had met
before. “I’d like to have you stay with me. This
is my home. Let us go indoors.”</p>

<p>Babs glanced about the one large room with
eager curiosity. The house they had entered was
more pretentious than the others in the village, but
that was natural, she decided, since it was the home
of the chief.</p>

<p>“Oh, Megsy, what adorable rugs are on this stone
floor,” Babs said softly, “and what warm, sunny
colors are in the blankets on the walls, and oh, oh,
if there isn’t a fireplace! And that queer-shaped
red pottery, and those blankets! I truly never saw
anything more artistic than this room. Why, I
don’t feel skeery at all.”</p>

<p>Winona had gone out of a rear door, and Virginia,
who had followed her, soon called to the
others. “If you want to see Winona’s bake-oven,
come out here.”</p>

<p>The rounding-topped stone oven in the dooryard
was evidently used by all the neighboring women,
and one buxom young mother, with a papoose
strapped to her back, was busy even then making
corn cakes. Winona said something in her own
tongue, and the young matron nodded. The Indian
maiden seemed pleased with the reply she had received,
and, going indoors, soon returned with a tray
of basket weave which she held out while the young
matron heaped it high with corn cakes, steaming hot,
that had just been taken from the oven.</p>

<p>“Oh, good! Are they for us?” Babs exclaimed.
The young matron did not understand the words,
but she beamed, being sure that whatever had been
said was in appreciation of her cooking.</p>

<p>“Supper will be served sooner than I had expected,”
Winona told them as they returned to the
house. “Red Feather will bring milk. He and
his older brother, Eagle Eyes, have gone to the upper
end of the valley after the goats.”</p>

<p>“Here he is now!” Barbara exclaimed five
minutes later as the little fellow appeared in the
open door and set on the floor a large earthen jug
that was nearly full of creamy milk.</p>

<p>Winona gave each of the girls a quaint red mug
and Babs exclaimed, “Oh, Winona, you have such
adorable things! I love this room of yours. I
wish I had one just like it.”</p>

<p>The Indian maiden knew, that bubbling as Babs
might be, she was also sincere and so she smilingly
replied, “I, too, like it. I shall remain here for a
time that I may teach my people, and then I want
to go away and learn more in the world from which
you have come.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go together!” Virginia said as they sat
about the fireplace, tailor-wise, on the floor, and ate
the hot corn cakes and drank the creamy milk.</p>

<p>“Who knows? Queer things do happen!” Margaret
commented meditatively.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry of delight from Virginia.
The others looked at her in surprise. She
was pointing and they followed her gaze. Under a
corner of the rug was caught a piece of brown paper
and there was scrawly writing upon it.</p>

<p>“The message!” Virg exclaimed, springing up.
“Oh, how I do hope I will be able to decipher it.”</p>

<p>Virginia gazed intently for one silent moment at
the bit of soiled brown paper, the others eagerly
watching and waiting. Babs stood by the side of
the western girl and peered at the scrawl which
meant nothing to her. The others did likewise.
“Can you read it, Virg?” Margaret inquired at
last.</p>

<p>The girl addressed, shook her head. “Not easily,”
she said. “The writing is very difficult to make out.
However, I am sure that the words are Spanish but
the letters are so queerly made it may take me a
long time to decipher it.”</p>

<p>“Why not leave it until morning” Winona suggested.
“It will soon be dark and I was going to invite
you girls to climb with me to the top of the
cliff trail to watch the sun set and the stars come
out. Of course sunsets are beautiful anywhere on
the desert, but I do feel that my own particular
sunset view is a little more wonderful than any
other that I have ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Let us go then,” Virginia said as she refolded
the bit of brown paper and placed it in her pocket,
“since this message can have nothing whatever to
do with us or our friends, I will postpone trying to
decipher the very queer writing until there is more
light. Lead on, Winona, and we will follow.”</p>

<p>As the girls wandered through the Indian village,
many unkempt little wolf-like children paused in
their antics to gaze wide-eyed at the “white face”
maidens whom they seemed to regard with awe as
though they were beings supernatural.</p>

<p>“Poor little kiddies!” Babs said softly to Margaret,
“I wonder if they really know how to play.”
Approaching the group nearest, she asked, “Little
folks, do you know how to play ‘Ring-around-a-rosie?”</p>

<p>Of course they could not understand, and the
smiling Winona came to be interpreter. Then the
oldest of the children, looking eagerly at Babs,
prattled something in her own tongue. “Will you
play it with them, Sunny Day wishes to know.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will,” Babs replied. “You three girls
may climb the cliff trail and look at the sunset. I’d
a heap rather romp with these solemn-eyed babies.
I want to see them smile and hear them laugh.”</p>

<p>And so Babs, in pantomime, explained the merry
game and soon had those Papago children whirling
about and shouting as gleefully as their leader
could desire.</p>

<p>The other three girls often looked back as they
climbed the cliff trail.</p>

<p>“Who is Barbara?” Winona asked. “I never
heard you speak of her, Virginia.”</p>

<p>“That is because Virginia never knew her,” Margaret
replied. “Babs was my roommate at boarding
school. She is such a dear, lovable girl, but, though
she seems happy-hearted, she is always grieving
for her lost brother. She cares more for him than
for any one else in the whole world, but it is so
long since she has heard from him, she believes him
to be dead.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” Winona said as they paused on the
summit. “I know what it is to be lonely, oh so
alone,” and the others glancing at the beautiful face
of the Indian maiden suddenly realized how truly
lonely she must be, for no one dwelling in the
Papago village could understand her aspirations
nor did they really appreciate what she was giving
up that she might help them, but Virginia understood,
and, slipping an arm about her friend she
held her close, then she reached out a hand to Margaret,
and so, together, they stood watching the
glowing west until the colors had faded and the first
star of evening twinkled faint and far.</p>

<p>“It will be a wonderful day tomorrow,” Virginia
said softly, little dreaming how truly wonderful the
next day was to be.</p>

<h2 title='THE MESSAGE FOUND' id='chXLIV'>
CHAPTER XLIV—THE MESSAGE FOUND.
</h2>

<p>The three girls, tired indeed from the long day
with its varied adventures, had found themselves
weary enough to sleep in the wide bed to which
Winona had referred, and even Babs had forgotten
to lie awake and listen for moccasined feet to creep
stealthily toward her beside as she had been so
sure that she should.</p>

<p>The fact was that the Papagoes seemed very kindly
folk, no longer thought of them as Indians, but
rather as simple, trusting, child-like friends.</p>

<p>It was just before dawn when Virginia awoke
with a start. She wondered what had awakened
her, and then as the sunlight streamed in through
the high opening that served as a window, she suddenly
thought of something. The message! Now
that it was daylight, she might be better able to
decipher it. She could not understand why she was
so curious concerning it, since it could have no
direct bearing upon her interests or those of her
friends.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was eager, and, so very quietly,
not to awaken the sleeping girls, she rose and
dressed. Then she slipped out to the main living-room.
Winona was in the rear door-yard baking
corn cakes in the stone oven, and, after greeting
her, Virginia seated herself on the adobe step of
the front porch to enjoy the warmth of the sun, for
the morning was crisply cold. Then opening the
brown paper, she studied it intently. On another
paper she carefully rewrote the forms of the
scrawled letters hoping that would enable her to
recognize them more readily, and it did, for when
she had three words copied, their meaning came
to her as though by inspiration. Her heart gave a
sudden leap and she could scarcely keep from crying
aloud to the other girls, but she decided to translate
the entire message, if she could, before awakening
them, for, after all, the first three words did not
give the needed information. She read them again
and again. Surely they were: “Los Boregos estan—the
sheep are—” but try as she might she could
not read the longer and more difficult words that
followed.</p>

<p>Margaret and Barbara soon sauntered out upon
the porch, but, so absorbed was Virginia that she
did not know of their near presence. Suddenly she
sprang up saying aloud, “We’ll do it! We’ll do it
at once.”</p>

<p>“Virginia Davis, you talking to yourself,” Margaret
teased, “Uncle Tex does that, but we excuse
him because he is so very old.”</p>

<p>“Don’t joke now, Megsy dear,” Virginia said
seriously, “I believe that we have come upon a matter
of great importance. This message may contain
information, if we can get at it, that may not
only restore to Mr. Wilson his stolen sheep, but
may also save the life of our dear friend Tom.”</p>

<p>Then she showed them the three words she had
copied and told them what she believed them to
mean.</p>

<p>“But Virg, dear,” Margaret said, “although I
sincerely hope that the message does refer to the
lost Merinos, you know that we are now in the sheep
country and those three words might refer to any
herd, shouldn’t you say so?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded. “You are right, Megsy. My
eagerness to find Tom makes me grasp at straws.
Nevertheless, I would never forgive myself if I
found out, too late, that this message did really
refer to Mr. Wilson’s lost sheep, and so, I will repeat
what you heard me saying to myself a minute
ago. We’ll do it and we’ll do it at once.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we have breakfast out here on the sunny
porch,” Winona said, appearing in the doorway
with a basket weave tray heaped with golden corn
bread hot from the oven. “Margaret, will you
bring the mugs that we used last night, and Barbara,
perhaps you will help her, as each one is filled
with steaming coffee.”</p>

<p>When the two girls had gone within, Winona
turned to Virginia who stood intent again upon the
message. Laying a slim, dark hand on the arm
of her friend, she asked, “Have you found the
meaning yet, Virginia?”</p>

<p>Virg glanced up, her cheeks flushed with excitement,
then, taking the hand of the Indian
maiden, she held it close as she said, “Winona, maybe,
just maybe, this message may tell us where to
find Tom, and oh, how I do want to find him.”</p>

<p>Tears sprang to her eyes as she added, “He is as
dear to me as a brother, I think.”</p>

<p>“Tom will be found,” Winona said in a tone of
quiet conviction.</p>

<p>Virginia looked up eagerly as she asked, “Winona,
you say that as though you really knew.”</p>

<p>The Indian girl looked out toward the cliffs and
in her eyes there was an expression as though she
were seeing a vision. “I cannot tell how I know,”
she said, then smiling directly into the eyes of her
friend, she added, “But I know.”</p>

<p>The good breakfast was rather hurriedly eaten,
for when the girls had heard what Virginia had decided
to do, they were all as much excited about it
as she.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that we are really, truly, going
to ride north to the Wilson Ranch,” Margaret exclaimed,
and Barbara equally amazed, added, “But
Virg, you said one had to cross the mountains that
we see towering above the cliff, did you not?”</p>

<p>The western girl nodded. “Aren’t you afraid
that we might take the wrong trail and be lost?”
Babs continued.</p>

<p>“You will not be lost.” It was Winona who had
spoken in that calm quieting voice of hers, “for
Red Feather and I will accompany you, and too,
perhaps Eagle Eyes would like to go. The lads
know every trail on these snow-capped mountains
and they are always glad to have an adventure,
whatever its nature.”</p>

<p>An hour later, the four girls, with the two Indian
boys in the lead, left the almost hidden entrance
in the wall of the rock and started on the
long hard ride toward the mountains far to the
north.</p>

<p>Virginia had carefully fastened the bit of brown
paper in a place of safety, and, as they rode along
in single file, her eyes were often on the trail ahead
of them, and her thoughts were with Tom. How
happy they would all try to make him at the V. M.
if only they could find him well and unharmed. She
and Margaret would let him know that they cared
for him like a brother and that they wished him
to feel that their home was also his home.</p>

<p>With a sudden thought of what might have happened
to him came to her, she closed her eyes and
tried not to look at the suggested picture, for, all
too well she knew how cruel rustlers could be when
they wished to dispose of a herder who might some
day be a witness against them.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it time to stop for lunch?” she heard Margaret
asking, and, so intently had she been thinking,
that her friend’s voice sounded far off.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe it is high sun,” she replied as
she glanced at the heavens.</p>

<p>“Oh, here is an adorable spot by this mountain
brook,” Babs said as they alighted, but, though Virginia
tried to listen to the chatter of her friends, her
thoughts kept wandering away to Tom. Suddenly,
glancing up, she found Winona’s calm gaze upon
her and a peace crept into her heart. The Indian
girl had said, “Tom will be found.”—But when
and where?</p>

<h2 title='ON A SHEEP RANCH' id='chXLV'>
CHAPTER XLV—ON A SHEEP RANCH.
</h2>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when the long ever upward
winding trail had been climbed, and, at last the girls
and their guides drew rein on the very summit,
where a few weeks before, little Red Feather had
paused to point to the valley below, that Outlaw
Tom might know which way to ride to reach the
Wilson Ranch.</p>

<p>In the sunlight the distant group of white buildings
could be plainly seen, and Virginia, noting that
their Papago friends were preparing to return, held
out her hand to Winona as she said, “Thank you.
We will let you know as soon as we can. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the big, rambling white ranch
house had been reached and the motherly Mrs. Wilson
having observed from her sitting room window
the approach of the strangers was out on the verandah
to greet them.</p>

<p>The girls leaped to the ground and Virginia going
forward extended her hand as she said, “Mrs.
Wilson, I am Virginia Davis and these are my
friends from the East, Margaret Selover and Barbara
Blair Wente. My brother Malcolm is here, is
he not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Virginia, you haven’t heard from
Tom, have you? We thought maybe, if he managed
to escape, he would try to reach the V. M. Ranch,
being as that was where he’d come from?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Wilson. Tom did not come to the
V. M., but I am very eager to speak with my
brother. Is he here now?”</p>

<p>Virginia awaited the answer almost breathlessly,
knowing that Malcolm might be away with one of
the searching parties.</p>

<p>“Well now, I’m not real sure as to where he is
right this minute,” the good woman replied, “but
here comes Lopez on his pinto. Like as not he can
tell us. Anyhow he can take your horses down to
the corral.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson beckoned to the young Mexican
herder, and then, in reply to her inquiry, he told her
that he believed Senor Davis was still at the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>He would stop there and see.</p>

<p>“Do come right in,” the motherly woman said,
“and sit a spell in the comfortable rockers. You
must be worn out, being so many hours in the
saddle.”</p>

<p>The eastern girls were indeed glad to avail themselves
of the invitation, but Virginia could not rest.
Oh, how she did wish Malcolm was there, for,
if the message did tell where Tom was being held
in captivity, every moment might be of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p>The doors opened and two young men entered.
“Oh, brother! brother!” Virginia exclaimed, rushing
toward the outstretched arms of Malcolm.
“Please don’t rebuke us for coming, for we have
news that we thought, or at least I thought, might
be of great importance.” Then she inquired
anxiously, “You have not heard from Tom?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, and his tone implied that they
had all but lost hope of hearing. Then he led his
sister to the rocker, saying tenderly, “You are
trembling like a leaf, Virginia. You are over tired
and excited, but I understand.”</p>

<p>Then he returned to welcome Margaret, who in
turn introduced Babs.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to remember formalities just now,” he
said. “You girls have become acquainted with Mrs.
Wilson. Now permit me to introduce her older
son, Harry.” Then turning to Virginia he inquired:
“Did you say, sister, that you have a message?”
Virginia hurriedly told the story of the captured
carrier pigeon and she knew by the eyes of her
listeners that they were all keenly interested. “May
I see that bit of brown paper?” Harry asked as
he held out his hand. “I will be able to read it.”
Virginia gave him the small paper and then they
all waited, scarcely breathing in their eagerness.
The ticking of the big clock on the wall was the
only sound that broke the stillness. Suddenly Harry
leaped to his feet, his face tense, “Malcolm,” he
cried, “there isn’t a minute to lose! Quick! Call the
herders, we’ll need all the help we can get.” Then,
not realizing that he had not told the message to
the girls, he left the house, and raced toward the
bunkhouse, shouting to Lopez.</p>

<p>In half an hour many things had been hurriedly
done. Malcolm, who had raced after Harry, returned
as he had promised Virginia that he would
to tell the girls the meaning of the message. It
was. “The sheep are south of Agua Prieta. Get
them at once. Drive to Rebano Rancho. Do away
with herders.”</p>

<p>“Brother! Brother!” Virginia sobbed. “Are we
too late? Have they done away with the herders?
Oh, tell me, what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Harry and I believe that whoever is to get the
sheep is still waiting for the carrier pigeon and
if so Tom may as yet be unharmed. Our hope is,
since the message has not been delivered, that we
may reach Agua Prieta before the rustlers receive
an order from some other source. If we do, we
may be able to regain the sheep and save our friend
Tom.” Then he added, “I know you girls are
terribly tired but I think that you would better return
with us as our way to Agua Prieta leads so
close to V. M. What do you think, Virginia?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wilson would not hear of it. “Do let
the poor dears rest,” she said. “They look as pale
as lilies and wilted ones at that. I’m expecting my
younger son, Benjy, to return home tomorrow and
on the day after he will gladly escort the girls to
V. M.”</p>

<p>Bab’s heart gave a leap of joy when she heard
that she was to see her friend Benjamin Wilson so
soon again, and that evening, when the young men
had ridden to the south, after having partaken of a
bounteous repast, the girls and Mrs. Wilson sat in
the big living-room where a log from the mountains
was burning cheerily on the hearth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had been delighted to find that Babs
knew her younger son and she wanted to know all
about the Drexel Military Academy, and so, to pass
the time and to permit Virginia to follow her own
thoughts uninterrupted, Babs recounted to a delighted
listener the story of her acquaintance, beginning
with the surprise Valentine party, where
she had first met Benjy, telling of the afternoon in
town where she and the lad had seats next to each
other at the theater, and ending with the April
Fool letter and the happy culmination of the romance
of their two instructors, Miss Piquilin and
Professor Pixley.</p>

<p>The good woman beamed at the petite girl whom
she thought almost too pretty and fragile “like a
bit of porcelain that ought to be kept in a glass
case,” but aloud she said, “I’m real glad you know
my boy. Like ’tis you’re about his age.”</p>

<p>“I’m fifteen,” Barbara replied, “and Benjy told
me that he would be sixteen this month I believe.”
Mrs. Wilson nodded, “Yes, my boy is sixteen
now.” Then she added with pride glowing in her
kindly eyes, “I don’t know where he took it from,
but he sure has a great head for the learning. His
teacher here in the Red Riverton school said that
Benjy didn’t no more than open his book before he
knew his lesson, seemed like. His daddy and I had
always had a hankering to have one son as would
have a college education, and so, ever since our
first boy came, we put away some money every
month in the old tea pot with the nose broken off
and we called it ‘Hal’s schoolin’ fund,’ but Harry
didn’t want a higher education and so he said, ‘Send
Benjy, mother. We’ll make a scholar of him, but
I’ll stick to the sheep raisin’.’ That’s how it came
that Benjy was sent East to school, but come now,
it’s late and I know you’re all tired out. Being as
there are three of you, how do you wish to divide?”</p>

<p>“We don’t divide,” Margaret laughingly replied.
“We sleep all together,” but there was one of the
three who did not close her eyes until morning, and
even then she did not sleep for over and over again
her thought kept repeating, “If only I could help
save Tom.”</p>

<h2 title='AN EARLY MORNING RIDE' id='chXLVI'>
CHAPTER XLVI—AN EARLY MORNING RIDE.
</h2>

<p>On the morning following the departure of
Harry, Malcolm and the herder, Lopez, the three
girls awakened with different emotions in their
hearts.</p>

<p>Virginia, who had not slept at all until nearly
morning, awoke with a sense of great weariness
and then, of even greater anxiety. It seemed
strange to her that she should care so much for
one whom she had known for so short a time. Perhaps
it was because Tom had seemed to need someone
to be loving and kind, he was so all alone in the
world. Barbara on the contrary, awakened with a
consciousness of a delighted anticipation, and
springing up, she merrily exclaimed, “Oh, girls,
just think! This is the day that you are to meet
that nice boy, Benjy Wilson. I wonder at what
hour he is to arrive?”</p>

<p>A surprise awaited them, for a little later, when
the three girls trooped out to the kitchen from
which a tempting odor of frying ham and eggs and
steaming coffee was wafted, they saw not only the
bustling, motherly woman, Mrs. Wilson, but standing
near the range, warming his hands over the
heat, was a tall, comely youth, dressed in the uniform
of a military academy.</p>

<p>He glanced up when he heard the girls entering,
and it was evident by his expression that his mother
had not told him of the near presence of his friend
from the East.</p>

<p>Leaping forward with outstretched hands, his
face alight, the lad exclaimed, “Am I seeing visions?
Miss Barbara, this surely cannot be you! Only
last week I rode over to your school to bid you
good-bye and ask when you were coming to visit
your friends in Arizona. I was told that all of the
pupils had suddenly departed because of an epidemic,
and I deeply regretted not being able to see
you and make plans for re-meeting you here on
the desert. I little supposed that you would be
awaiting me in my very own home.”</p>

<p>Barbara laughed. “I do not wonder that you
are amazed,” she declared. “We three girls have
been living in a whirl of strange adventure of late,
and honestly I am not at all sure that we are real.
Perhaps, as you first suggested, we may be merely
visions, and yet,” she added doubtfully as she
sniffed the appetizing odors, “can a vision be
ravenously hungry for ham and eggs and coffee?
But I am quite forgetting my manners. Doesn’t
it seem queer that I had to cross a continent to introduce
Miss Virginia Davis to her neighbor, Mr.
Benjamin Wilson? This other fair maid with violets
for eyes and the dimples we all envy, is, or
rather was, my room-mate, Margaret Selover, of
whom I have often told you.”</p>

<p>Benjy acknowledged the introductions with a
grace of manner which he had readily acquired during
his year at the military academy, and his fond
mother watching the lad, her eyes shining with
pride, secretly congratulated herself that she and
“pa” had gone without many little things that the
money might be put in the broken nosed tea-pot for
Benjy’s education fund.</p>

<p>“Come to breakfast everybody,” she now sang
out in her pleasant, hearty way, “and do eat all that
you possibly can for you have a long ride ahead of
you.</p>

<p>“But there, Benjy doesn’t know a word of all
that has happened. He arrived just a few minutes
ago and took me so by surprise that I’ve hardly got
my breath to coming right yet. Do set down, all
of you, and while you’re eating, suppose you tell
my boy just what has happened. Then, if he isn’t
too tired with traveling, I’m sure he’ll be pleased
to escort you back to V. M. ranch. Maybe though,
he’d rather be waitin’ till tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Benjy’s curiosity had been greatly aroused by
this conversation which suggested interesting adventure
of some kind, and so as soon as the young people
were seated, he begged Babs to begin at the beginning
and tell him all that had happened. As the
story progressed the boy ceased eating and listened
with eager intentness, and when Babs finished
speaking, Benjy exclaimed, “We will not wait until
tomorrow. With mother’s permission we will start
south as soon as I can get into my riding togs.”</p>

<p>It was still early morning when the four riders departed
from the group of white ranch buildings,
the girls having bidden the kind Mrs. Wilson an affectionate
farewell, promising that, as soon as Tom
had been found, they would return and spend a
week on the sheep ranch.</p>

<p>The good woman looked with especial interest at
the petite Barbara. “Poor little lamb,” she was
thinking with sudden tears in her eyes. “Such a mite
of a girl to be all alone in the world without a
mother and her poor brother lost. How proud that
mother would have been had she lived, for a sweeter,
prettier, little girl never trod this earth.” Then, as
she returned indoors, having waved for the last
time to the riders, who were rapidly disappearing
toward the mountains, she recalled the tall-good-looking
lad whom she had seen riding close to Barbara’s
side.</p>

<p>“I wish my boy might be worthy of a girl like
little Barbara,” she thought. “A fine pair they would
make and what happiness ’twould be for them both,
and for me.” Then as she happened to glance into
the hat-rack mirror, she smiled a queer little smile
with lips that were quivering. “Well, now, Matilda
Wilson,” she said aloud to her reflection, “if you
aren’t matchmaking, and it’s a thing you’ve always
said you wouldn’t do, for it’s just a interferin’ in
other folks’ lives. What’s more, the two of them are
only children, still a-going to school, but I guess
mothers are all the same,” she added as she went
kitchenward, “first off we try to keep our boys just
little fellows and then, when all of a sudden we see
that they’re nearly young men, we begin to choose a
girl we want them to marry, but I’ll try to welcome
whoever they choose just as I’d want some other
boy’s mother to welcome a girl of mine if I had one.”
Then, as the good woman poured boiling water over
a great pan full of dishes, her thoughts wandered,
with equal pride, from Benjy to her older son,
Harry. “Whoever gets Hal for a husband,” she
thought, “gets a man to lean on who won’t prove a
bending reed when trouble comes. He hasn’t the
nice, easy manner, maybe, that Benjy has, but Hal’s
honest and dependable. He never seemed to take to
girls, though, so maybe he won’t be one to marry,
but, if he does, I wonder, now, who it will be. I
hope someone I’d like real well, but if ’tisn’t, I won’t
let that make any difference. The dear boy will
never know it, or the girl either.”</p>

<p>It almost seemed as if the mother heart knew instinctively
that Harry’s choice was to be someone of
whom she could not really approve, and yet, how
could she know, for Harry had not even met the
girl who was to be the one dearest of all in his life.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when the four riders drew
near the walled-in Papago village and Virginia
suggested that they lunch with her dear
friend Winona, daughter of the Chief Grey Hawk.</p>

<p>Benjy was surprised to hear the proud declaration
of friendship that this white girl made for a
maiden of a race so unlike her own, but he said
nothing, although he secretly wondered what manner
of a maid Winona might be.</p>

<p>Virginia had no trouble whatever in finding the
almost hidden entrance in the mountain wall that
surrounded the Papago village for she had carefully
noted its exact relation to the clump of cactus on
her last visit, and so it was that Winona, happening
to look up from the little class which she had
gathered about her in the shade of the cliff, was
both delighted and surprised to see the four riders
approaching her, three of whom she knew. The
lad she had never seen before.</p>

<p>Springing up, with the grace which was always
in her every movement, she approached the girls
who had dismounted with outstretched hands, and
Benjy was amazed to note the real beauty of the
dusky maiden whose noble, intelligent face was
aglow with the joy of so soon again seeing her beloved
Virginia.</p>

<p>The lad acknowledged his introduction to the Indian
girl and heard her saying, “You are the son
of our nearest neighbor to the north? We Papagoes
often climb to the summit of the mountain overlooking
your ranch, Mr. Wilson, but we never descend
on the other side. Our pilgrimages always take
us to the south it would seem.”</p>

<p>Then to Virginia she added, “It is high sun, so
let us go to my home and lunch together.” Turning
to the group of unkempt little Indian girls who
still seated on the ground, were watching wide-eyed
she said something in their own tongue. The
listeners concluded that it was a dismissal of the
class for the morning, and they were right, for with
joyful little cries such as delighted puppies might
have uttered, the Indian children sprang up, then to
the utter amazement of the watching lad, they surrounded
the smiling Babs who, reaching out her
arms, gathered in as many of them as she could.</p>

<p>Benjy’s first impulse was to draw Barbara away
from the embrace of the “Indian brats,” but when
that girl looked up at him, her pretty flower face
aglow, he realized that they weren’t wild, uncouth
creatures to her, but just little children who loved
her, and who were begging her in their own queer
language to come and play with them “Ring-around-a-rosie.”</p>

<p>When Winona had interpreted their request,
Barbara exclaimed merrily, “The rest of you may
prepare the lunch. Until it is ready I’ll romp with
the kiddies.”</p>

<p>“May I play, too?” Benjy heard himself asking.
Babs nodded gaily, and while the three older girls
went indoors to prepare a simple meal of cold corn
bread, milk and fruit, Barbara and Benjy skipped
about with the shouting little Indian children in a
circle which was ever widening because of the arrival of other youngsters who were attracted from
their dooryards by the sounds of merriment.</p>

<p>It was 2 o’clock before the riders, having said
farewell to Winona and to the children, left the
walled-in village and started on the long four-hours’
ride toward V. M.</p>

<p>Uncle Tex had seen them coming from afar. In
fact, the old man had gone every hour to the window
to look toward the sand hills to see if his Miss
Virginia was returning. What joy there was in
that faithful heart when the girl whom he so loved
leaped from her horse and embraced him. “Dear
Uncle Tex,” she said, “is there any news? Tell
me quickly what has happened? Did Malcolm come
this way?”</p>

<p>The old man nodded. “Yes, Miss Virginia, dear,
but Mister Malcolm didn’t stop long, just to tell
me what ’twas he planned doin’ and bid me keep a
watchout fo’ yo’. Ah’s been that anxious, Miss
Virginia, dearie, but Ah’ll feel better now, as yo’
are home again.” Then when the girls had gone to
their rooms, the old man said in a low voice to
Benjy; “Ah don’ want to worry the gals more’n
need be, but Ah’s powerful anxious about Malcolm
and yo’ brother, for they has gone to a mighty
dangerous place. Ah knows the rustlers over the
border and thar’s nothin’ as they’d stop at, but shh!
Here come the gals. Make out as we was talkin’ of
suthin’ else.” But Benjy’s anxiety had been greatly
increased and though he did talk of something else,
his thoughts were busily trying to contrive some
way that he might leave the girls and ride to his
brother’s assistance.</p>

<p>The young people had reached the ranch in the
late afternoon and half an hour after their arrival
Uncle Tex suddenly realized that it was nearing the
supper hour and that probably the newcomers would
be very hungry after their long hard ride and so
he departed kitchenward to prepare the evening repast.</p>

<p>He had been gone only a few minutes, however,
when he returned to the living-room, and, one
glance at his face convinced the young people he
had something to tell them which had greatly excited
him.</p>

<p>“Horsemen a comin’. Like ’tis three or four,” he
said. “Yo’ all can see them from the kitchen porch.
Ah’s a hopin’ it’s Malcolm and the rest, but they’re
too far off yet to be tellin’.”</p>

<p>With rapidly beating hearts the young people
hurried to the high porch at the back of the house
and Virginia gazed through the powerful glasses.</p>

<p>“Uncle Tex is right,” she said. “I see several
dark objects moving in this direction and I am sure
they are horsemen. Oh, how I do hope Tom is with
them. I haven’t slept, that is, not restfully, since
I knew that Tom was lost.”</p>

<p>Margaret, noting that Virginia looked pale and
worn from days of anxiety, slipped an arm about
her friend and led her back to the living-room.</p>

<p>“Let’s rest,” she said, “while Uncle Tex prepares
supper. I’m sure he would rather have us out of
the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay and help!” Benjy told them. “I’m a fine
cook, if I do say it. I’ve had a lot of experience
when in camp with the herders.”</p>

<p>The truth was that Benjy was eager to be alone
with the old man that he might learn from him
what he really thought about the approach of the
riders.</p>

<p>When the girls were gone, the boy closed the
door very softly that it might not attract their attention
nor arouse their curiosity, then going to the
range where the old man was replenishing the fire
he asked, “Uncle Tex, did you think you saw four
horsemen?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. “No, Mista Benjy.
I don’t honest believe I did. Maybe ’twas though,
and maybe ’twasn’t. Wall, we’ll soon know, for if
’tis Malcolm, he’ll be here ’bout as soon as we have
supper ready.”</p>

<p>Never was a half hour passed in greater anxiety,
but even when supper was ready and waiting the
horsemen did not appear.</p>

<p>“Perhaps after all they were bound for the Slater
Ranch,” Virginia said.</p>

<p>Disappointed and with a feeling of depression the
young people gathered about the table when suddenly
they heard a shouting without, and in another
moment the front door burst open.</p>

<h2 title='APPROACHING HORSEMEN' id='chXLVII'>
CHAPTER XLVII—APPROACHING HORSEMEN.
</h2>

<p>Virginia leaped forward with a cry of joy and
was caught in her brother’s close embrace. Harry
followed, but though they all gazed eagerly back of
these two, hoping to see another lad coming in from
the gathering darkness, none appeared. Hal was
closing the door, and so, of course, there was no one
to come.</p>

<p>“Oh, brother,” Virginia exclaimed, “you didn’t
find Tom. Tell me quickly what has happened?”</p>

<p>“That I will,” was the reply, “but since Harry
and I are almost famished, may I tell the story while
we are at supper?”</p>

<p>A few moments later, when they were gathered
about the table, Uncle Tex standing near, Malcolm
related their experiences.</p>

<p>“We followed the directions in the message taken
from the carrier pigeon, and reached the mountain
pass south of Agua Prieta where we expected to
find the sheep. Lopez knows several Mexicans living
in Agua Prieta; in fact, he has relatives there,
and they gladly joined us when we told them what
the reward would be if we could regain the lost
Merinos and save our friend, Tom. It was nearing
nightfall when we ascended a mountain on foot to a
point where we could look over into the pass. There,
to our great delight, we beheld the lost flock. Two
Mexicans, whom Lopez recognized as well known
rustlers, were seated by a camp fire close to a jutting
boulder near the entrance of the pass. Lopez offered
to creep as close as he could to them and report
their conversation. This he did while we waited at
the outer entrance, our guns drawn, for well we
knew that if Lopez made the slightest sound, or in
any way betrayed his near presence, he would need
our immediate assistance. But luckily the two
rustlers were so engrossed with their own grievances
that they were not on the outlook for spies.</p>

<p>“After a time Lopez crept back and beckoned us to
follow him, which we did.</p>

<p>“He led us some distance away, where in a cave-like
shelter, he told us what he had heard. Our
friend Tom, he said, was alive unless he had starved.
The sheep were all there and the men were impatiently
awaiting the carrier pigeon which was to
bring them further orders.</p>

<p>“‘But Tom?’ I said. ‘Tell us where he is that
we may go at once to his assistance.’ Lopez looked
troubled. Then he told us that our friend had been
practically buried alive. That is, he had been imprisoned
in an adobe hut and without food. The
boy Francesco Quintano Mendoza was with him.
‘Tom must have been in that tomb for over a
week,’ I said, ‘and if he has been without food all
that time of course he is dead; but let us go to him
at once.’</p>

<p>“Lopez, it seemed, did not know the location of the
adobe hut. However, one of the men from Agua
Prieta did know, and he led us to the place which
was not far distant. My heart was heavy and sad
as we approached that lonely crumbling old adobe
hut, wooden windows and doors of which were
fastened with iron bars. I was sure we would find
that Tom and the faithful little Mexican boy had
starved, but, as we neared, Lopez uttered an exclamation,
pointing to a hole near the ground which
had evidently been made by the prisoners. It was
small, but Lopez managed to creep through and
enter the hut. He soon reappeared assuring us that
it was empty. This was indeed good news and we
at once returned to Agua Prieta where we were to
spend the night. There we were informed that a
young man answering Tom’s description and a small
Mexican boy had left the day before on foot and had
gone toward the north. Harry and I rode away
from the Mexican village early this morning, Lopez
having remained to get possession of the flock if he
could. Hal and I did not ride directly to V. M. but
instead we followed many side trails, hoping that
we would come upon Tom, but when nightfall was
approaching, we decided to come home and start
out again tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>“And I will accompany you,” Benjy said eagerly.</p>

<h2 title='TOM’S RETURN' id='chXLVIII'>
CHAPTER XLVIII—TOM’S RETURN.
</h2>

<p>Everyone in the ranch house the next morning
was astir long before daybreak. The boys breakfasted
at once and were in the saddle just as the sun
was rising above the low line of the desert horizon
in the far East.</p>

<p>How the girls did wish they, too, might accompany
the lads who were to separate, each following
a different trail that they might surely find Tom
if he were endeavoring to walk to V. M. Each boy
was leading a saddle horse, knowing only too well
that Tom, after his week of starvation, would be
greatly enfeebled. Malcolm advised them all to ride
slowly, hallooing often and searching each sand
hollow and mesquite clump which they might pass.</p>

<p>“We must make every effort to save poor Tom
and the faithful little Mexican boy,” he told them before
they parted on the south bank of the dry creek.</p>

<p>The three girls stood on the high back porch
watching the lads ride away until one by one they
had disappeared, or had become but moving specks
in the far distance.</p>

<p>Then they re-entered the ranch house. “It’s much
harder to remain at home and do nothing than it is
to be actively assisting in the search,” Margaret declared,
“but since Malcolm believed that we would
better remain here, of course we must abide by his
decision.”</p>

<p>“Brother thought that Tom might return to V. M.
without having been found by the boys and of
course if he does we will wish to be here to welcome
him,” Virginia said. A busy morning followed,
Virg assisted Uncle Tex with the baking, while the
other girls tidied the house. Then, after lunch,
they went to their rooms to try to rest, and so weary
were they, that in spite of their anxiety, they slept.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when the girls gathered with
their sewing in the big cool living-room.</p>

<p>“Barbara, will you go to the kitchen porch and
look toward the Seven Peak Trail and see what you
can see.”</p>

<p>Babs complied with Virginia’s wish but returned
shaking her head.</p>

<p>“I looked through the glass, Virg, in all directions,”
she said, “but I saw nothing at all that was
moving.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” Virginia exclaimed, sitting up and listening
intently, “Megsy, dear, didn’t you hear a hallooing
just then, or is it something my own ears
hear that isn’t real?”</p>

<p>Babs and Margaret hurried to the window and
opened it wide. Again they heard the hallooing,
close at hand.</p>

<p>“Two horses are coming,” Megsy exclaimed excitedly,
“and yes, surely the rider in the lead is
Malcolm and on the horse following there are two,
so it must be Tom, though his hat is drawn down
so far I cannot see his face.”</p>

<p>Virginia joined the others. “It is! It surely
must be Tom,” she cried, her cheeks flushed with excitement,
her eyes aglow with hope.</p>

<p>The girls turned as the door burst open and Malcolm
entered, followed truly enough by the lost Tom,
looking pale and worn. Before anyone could speak, a
glad cry rang out, and everyone turned to look at
Babs whose face was radiant with sudden joy.</p>

<p>“Peyton! My brother!”</p>

<p>“Little sister! God is good!” The lad held the girl
close and there were tears in his eyes. Then he
reached a hand out to Virginia, and Margaret,
watching, knew by the way that he looked at the
western girl, that he too cared.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when Tom had recounted
his recent thrilling adventures, Virg rose, saying
that since they must be about starved, she would prepare
the evening meal.</p>

<p>“I wish the others would return in time for supper,”
Babs said. “Speak of angels and you hear
the rustle of their wings,” Margaret sang out, holding
up a finger as she spoke. Without could be
heard the galloping of horses’ feet.</p>

<p>“Rather say, ‘bad pennies are sure to turn up,’
Malcolm exclaimed laughingly, adding with sudden
seriousness, “but that is hardly fair, for a finer chap
than Harry Wilson it would be hard to find.” Then,
as he glanced out of the window he informed the
others. “It is Hal, and his younger brother, I
judge, is with him. They are dismounting down
by the corral. Mendoza Quintano is racing to meet
them. He just adores Harry. When Hal sees the
Mexican lad, he will, of course, know that Tom has
been found. Sure enough, here he comes sprinting
at top speed.”</p>

<p>A second later, Harry Wilson sprang through
the door which Malcolm had opened for him, and
going to Tom, he embraced him as tenderly as he
would a brother.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon Babs and her brother were
alone; Virginia having thoughtfully arranged it,
for she felt sure that the reunited brother and sister
would have much to say to each other just by themselves.</p>

<p>“Peyton,” Babs said, slipping her hand in his,
“you haven’t asked me about father.”</p>

<p>“Dad doesn’t care about me,” the boy said sorrowfully,
“I wish he did.”</p>

<p>Barbara was about to tell her brother all that had
happened and how changed her father was, when
something occurred to assure him of this more forcefully
than Babs could have done.</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by a gentle
tapping on the closed door, and Virginia’s voice
called, “Babs, dear, Lucky just rode in with the
mail. There are several letters for you and one that
I thought you and Peyton might like to read together.”
The young people had agreed to call Tom
by his real name, although at first this would be
hard to do.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Barbara replied, while the lad, having
leaped to his feet, opened the door and took
the letters from Virginia.</p>

<p>A second later Babs exclaimed, “Oh, brother,
here is one from poor dear father. I always think
of him pityingly, ever since the day when I returned
from school unexpectedly and found him pacing up
and down in the library looking so desolate and so
all alone. I didn’t understand then, but now I
know that through the three years that you have
been away he has been grieving for you. I shall
never forget how he reached out his arms, when he
saw me, and how tenderly he said, ‘You are like
your mother, Barbara. She came to me when I
needed her most just as you have come. If only
that other Barbara had lived, all this would not
have happened.’ He meant that our dear mother
would have understood you better.” Then, after a
moment Barbara added, “But brother, I wonder if
you and I have ever really tried to understand our
father. There must be a very kind heart under his
reserve, else our mother, who was so joyous in her
nature, would not have loved him. We never
thought of it before that way, did we, brother?”</p>

<p>“No,” the lad replied, and there was a quiver in
his voice. “I was very young and very head-strong
and I felt, if I wanted to ruin my life, as dad declared
that I would, it was my own life and I ought
to be permitted to ruin it. Read the letter, sister.
What has our father written?”</p>

<p>But, though Babs tried hard, she could not read
aloud the message. The true feeling of her father,
that had never been expressed in spoken words to
his children, was revealed to them in the few heartbroken
sentences that he had penned.</p>

<p>“Barbara, my little girl, I hope you will want to
go home with me. You are all I have now. I have
searched this country over and I cannot find my
son; my other Barbara’s little boy, and how she
loved him! I wanted to find him that I might ask
him to forgive me, for I believe that somehow the
fault must have been mine.”</p>

<p>“Babs! Little sister!” Peyton exclaimed as he
sprang up. “Where is father now? I am going to
him, at once, tonight if I can.”</p>

<p>The other young people were surprised to learn
that Peyton had decided to leave for Texas, that
very night, but Virginia was indeed glad when she
learned that he was to be reunited with his father.</p>

<p>After supper the other boys accompanied Peyton
to the Junction where he departed on the 10 o’clock
train.</p>

<p>The next morning Harry and Benny rode away,
promising, however, that they would return in a
fortnight, when Margaret and Barbara were planning
a surprise house party for Virginia’s seventeenth
birthday.</p>

<p>The further adventures of these young people will
be found in a book entitled, “Virginia of V. M.
Ranch and Her Friends.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
